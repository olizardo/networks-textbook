# Structural Holes and Brokerage {#sec-sht}

Ronald Burt's [-@burt95] Theory of Structural Holes is a significant foundation in social network analysis that builds upon and extends Granovetter's [-@granovetter73] Strength of Weak Ties theory. While Granovetter's theory emphasizes the value of weak ties for accessing novel information, Burt's theory focuses on how individuals can strategically leverage gaps in social networks to gain advantages and control information flow.

## Key Concepts

- **Structural Holes**: These are defined as absent links in the social structure, particularly in person to person relations. In graph theory terms, structural holes exist whenever a person connects to two other actors who are not themselves connected, representing a structural gap between distinct groups or individuals in a network.
- **Broker**: An individual who connects different clusters or groups in a network is known as a broker, a broker "stands between" or intermediates between different clusters in the network thus reaping information exposure and information control advantages. Another way of saying this is that the broker bridges structural holes in the network.
- **Network Constraint**: This term describes the opposite of having structural holes. In a high-constraint network, an individual's contacts are interconnected, meaning there is redundancy in information. Individuals in such networks are often bound by the norms and expectations of a single group and depend on others within that group for information access.

## Core Principles and Benefits

Burt's Structural Holes theory highlights how individuals positioned in structural holes can control information and accrue social capital.  Structural holes provide two primary types of benefits to the individuals who bridge them (brokers):

1. *Passive Exposure Effect*: Brokers gain access to diverse information from different parts of the network that would otherwise be inaccessible. Because the groups they connect are not directly linked to each other, the information flowing through the broker is likely to be novel and non-redundant. This contrasts with strong ties, which often provide redundant information because closely connected individuals tend to know the same people and share similar information.
2. *Active Control Effect*: Beyond just receiving diverse information, brokers can actively control how information flows between disconnected groups. They can decide what information to transmit, shape how others perceive it, or even "play people against one another". This strategic position allows them to synthesize diverse information from various sources to create novel combinations and generate better ideas.

Individuals who have networks rich in structural holes (i.e., low network constraint) tend to achieve greater career success. Evidence suggests that in corporate settings, people with such networks receive higher salaries, get promoted faster, and receive better performance evaluations [@burt95]. They are also less bound by the norms and expectations of any single group, giving them more freedom to move across the social structure and interact with different people and ideas.

## Examples and Applications

- *Innovation and Idea Generation*: Individuals bridging structural holes are in a prime position to combine disparate pieces of information, leading to new insights and creative ideas. For example, a scientist who collaborates across different research silos might be able to combine theories or methods in novel ways that those deeply embedded within a single silo might miss.
- *Cultural Holes*: The concept of structural holes has been extended to "cultural holes," which are absent links in the "cultural structure". This involves relations between cultural entities. For instance, a person who bridges cultural holes might choose items from different cultural genres. Communication across cultural holes can be challenging, but being a broker in such a context can be beneficial.

In essence, Burt's Structural Holes theory emphasizes that having diverse contacts who are not connected to each other (i.e., operating across structural holes) provides unique benefits in terms of information access, control, and ultimately, social capital.

## Types of Brokerage

Brokerage can occur both within and between groups. Analysts have identified distinct types of brokerage than can occur in social networks [@gould_fernandez89]:

1. *Within-Group Brokers*: These individuals operate within a single defined group.
    - **Coordinators**: A coordinator connects two people within the same group who would otherwise not be connected. The coordinator themselves is also a member of this group. This type of brokerage helps facilitate connections and potentially new syntheses within an existing cluster.
    - **Itinerant Brokers**: Similar to coordinators, an itinerant broker connects two individuals within a group, but the broker themselves is not part of that specific group. This role suggests a more external, consultative function in facilitating internal group ties.
2. Between-Group Brokers: These individuals span across different, often disconnected, groups.
    - **Gatekeepers**: A gatekeeper grants access from someone outside their group to someone within their own group. They control the flow of information or resources into their group.
    - **Representatives**: A representative connects people from their own group to individuals outside their group. They act as an outward-facing link for their group.
    **Liaisons**: A liaison connects three actors, all of whom belong to different groups. This is the most expansive form of between-group brokerage, involving connections across multiple distinct social spheres.

These types of brokerage can be measured by counting the number of triads of each type, normalizing by the possibility of such counts occurring by random matching, and requiring the sorting of nodes into groups.

### Forms of Brokering Process

Beyond the structural roles, brokerage can also be understood as a *process* with different forms of action [@obstfeld14]. Structural holes represent opportunities for brokerage, but realizing these opportunities requires motivation and action. Three forms of brokering are identified:

1. **Conduit Forms**: This involves the straightforward transfer of information, ideas, or solutions. It's about problem-solving through synthesis. Structural hole brokerage is a primary example of conduit brokerage. This can also occur within groups, leading to "within group syntheses," even without a "hole" in the traditional sense.
2. **Tertius Gaudens** ("the third who benefits"): In this form, the broker exploits the relationship between two other parties (alters) by keeping them disconnected or actively encouraging conflict between them ("divide and conquer"). This grants the broker control over their interaction.
3. **Tertius Lungens** ("the third who joins"): This form describes a broker who actively connects or facilitates interactions between alters. This can involve closing off a structural hole by bringing previously disconnected individuals into direct contact, or by coordinating interactions among those who are already connected but not necessarily interacting efficiently.
