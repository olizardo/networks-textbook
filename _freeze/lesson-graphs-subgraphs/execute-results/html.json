If all the actors that you are interested in studying are included here, we would refer to it as the **whole network**. However, sometimes, even when we collect data on a large number of actors we may be interested in analyzing not the whole network, but only some parts of it. How do we do that?\n\n\n::: {#fig-subgraph .cell layout-ncol=\"2\" fig-cap-location='margin'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Original graph](lesson-graphs-subgraphs_files/figure-html/fig-subgraph-1.png){#fig-subgraph-1 width=768}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A subgraph of the original graph.](lesson-graphs-subgraphs_files/figure-html/fig-subgraph-2.png){#fig-subgraph-2 width=768}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Another subggraph of the original graph.](lesson-graphs-subgraphs_files/figure-html/fig-subgraph-3.png){#fig-subgraph-3 width=768}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![An edge deleted subgraph of the original graph.](lesson-graphs-subgraphs_files/figure-html/fig-subgraph-4.png){#fig-subgraph-4 width=768}\n:::\n\nA graph (a) and a subgraph (b).\n:::\n\n\nWell, good thing that a graph is actually a set of two sets. If you remember your high school set theory, you can always take a set and consider only a **subset** of the original members.\n\nSince graphs are sets, we can do the same thing. A subset of the original nodes (or edges) of a graph, is called a **subgraph**. So if $G =\\{E,V\\}$ is the original graph, the subgraph $G' = \\{E',V'\\}$ is a subset of $G$, which is written $G \\subset G'$, with the understanding that $E' \\subset E$ and $V' \\subset V$. In mathematics, \"$\\subset$\" is the symbol for subset. Thus, $A \\subset B$ is read as \"set A is a subset of set B.\"\n\nFor instance, let us say we are interested in just analyzing actors *A*, *B*, *C*, *D*, and *E* in the graph shown in @fig-subgraph-1. They seem to be a close-knit group of people. In that case, as noted earlier, if we call the original graph $G$ with vertex and edge sets $\\{E, V\\}$we can define a new subgraph $G'$, whose node subset $V'$ only includes the actors we are interested in studying, in this case $V' = \\{A, B, C, D, E\\}$, where $V' \\subset V$.\n\nThe subgraph $G'$ is shown in @fig-subgraph-2. It looks exactly like we wanted, capturing the relations between an inter-connected subgroup of actors in the original graph. Note that the edge set of the subgraph $E'$ only includes those edges that are **incident** to the other nodes in the subgraph (as defined in @sec-graphtheory) and omits those in the original graph that are incident to nodes that are not in the subgraph, so $E' \\subset E$. As we will see in a later lesson, well-connected subgroups of actors of an original graph are called a **cohesive subset**.\n\n## Vertex and Edge-Induced Subgraphs\nFor any graph, we can define a subgraph based on *any* old random subset of the original node set. It is completely up to us. For instance, we could define a new subgraph $G''$ of the original graph shown in @fig-subgraph-1, that includes the node set $V'' = \\{D, E, G, I\\}$. That is shown in @fig-subgraph-3. That subgraph is weird (composed of two standalone connected dyads) and probably not very useful, but it is a subgraph of the original graph anyways!\n\nJust like we can define subgraphs based on the node set of a graph, we can define subgraphs based on subsets of the original edge set. For instance, we could pick the edges $E' = \\{AB, AC, AJ\\}$ and define a subgraph based on them, which will necessarily include node set $V' = \\{A, B, C, J\\}$.\n\nWhen a subgraph is defined by selecting a subset of nodes to keep (the common case) it is called a **vertex-induced subgraph** of the original graph, like @fig-subgraph-2. When a subgraph is defined by picking a subset of edges from the original graph to keep, it is called (you guessed it) an **edge-induced subgraph** of the original graph.\n\n## Vertex and Edge-Deleted Subgraphs\nA common reason for defining subgraphs in social network analysis is when we wonder what a network would look like if were to get rid of an actor or a set of actors. Sometimes this is useful, when we want to get a sense of how important that set of actors is for holding the network together. \n\nSo it is possible to define a subgraph by *deleting* nodes. This is written $G' = G - \\{a, b, c\\}$, where $\\{a, b, c\\}$ is the set of nodes we are deleting. So this says \"give me a subgraph $G'$ that is equal to the original graph $G$ *minus* nodes $\\{a, b, c\\}$.\" In our previous example, @fig-subgraph-2 is the subgraph that results when we delete nodes $\\{F, G, H, I, J\\}$ from the graph in @fig-subgraph-1: $G' = G - \\{F, G, H, I, J\\}$. This is called a **vertex-deleted subgraph** of the original graph. \n\nThe subgraph that results from removing *all* the nodes of the original graph (so that the cardinality of the node set is now zero) is called the **null graph**. The subgraph that results from removing all the nodes of the original graph *except* for one (so that the cardinality of the node set of the resulting subgraph is equal to one) is called the **singleton graph**, also called the **trivial graph** as we saw in @sec-graphtheory (one is indeed a lonely number in social networks).\n\nJust like we can create subgraphs by deleting nodes, we can also create subgraphs by removing *edges*. For instance @fig-subgraph-4 is the subgraph that results from removing edges $\\{AB, AE, AC, CI, CE, GJ\\}$ from the graph shown in @fig-subgraph-1. This is written $G' = G - \\{AB, AE, AC, CI, CE, GJ\\}$, which says \"give me a new graph $G'$ which is equal to the original graph $G$ *minus* edges $\\{AB, AE, AC, CI, CE, GJ\\}$. This is called the **edge-deleted subgraph** of the original graph. \n\nA subgraph created by removing *only* edges, but leave *all* the nodes of the original graph intact, like in @fig-subgraph-4, is also called a **spanning subgraph** of the original graph. \n\nThe subgraph that results from removing *all* the edges in a graph, such that the cardinality of the edge set turns to zero, is called the **empty graph.**\n\nAs we will see later, subgraphs (as well as vertex and edge deletion) are a useful concept for discussing levels at an \"in-between\" levels, above the node level but \"below\" the whole network level: subgroups. However, subgraphs are also useful for network concepts at the node level, because there is a special type of subgraph, called the **ego graph** that is defined by picking a central node and the nodes that are connected to it, along with the edges connecting the nodes surrounding ego. \n",
