# The Strength of Weak Ties {#sec-swt}

The theory of the Strength of Weak Ties, introduced by Mark @granovetter73, posits that weaker social connections can be more valuable than strong ties, especially for accessing novel information and opportunities. This theory is a key foundational element of social network analysis.

## Defining Tie Strength
The strength of a tie is defined as a combination of four elements: the amount of time spent together, the emotional intensity of the relationship, the level of intimacy (mutual confiding), and the reciprocal services or exchanges that characterize the tie [@granovetter73]. work.

- **Strong Ties**: These ties are characterized by having lasted a long time, being frequently activated, involving high emotional intimacy, and featuring frequent exchanges of favors. For example, your closest kin and best friends typically form your "support clique" (around 4-5 people) and "sympathy group" (around 12-15 people), can be classified as strong ties [@dunbar14]. Similar-race ties, kin-ties, and positive sentiment ties are likely to be strong. Strong ties are also associated with more trust, intimacy, and cooperativeness, and are more effective at transferring complex or interdependent information. They foster commonality of interests and experience through **homophily** [@mcpherson01].

- **Weak Ties**: These ties are typically characterized by having recently started, being infrequently activated, lacking emotional intimacy, and not featuring many exchanges of favors. Acquaintanceship ties and coworker ties are examples of relationships that are likely to be weak. Note that, just having one of the tie strength properties, like frequent activation, isn't enough for a tie to be strong. For instance, you might see a coworker every weekday and even hate them, but this frequent interaction alone doesn't make the tie strong if intimacy and exchange are low. Similarly, a former best friend from college with whom you've lost touch might become a weak tie if the frequency of interaction decreases, despite past intimacy and exchanges.

Tie strength is a crucial measure for ego networks. Researchers often use indicators like closeness/intimacy, frequency of interaction, duration, and exchange/support to assess the strength of an existing tie. Predictors of tie strength include role relations (e.g., friend, coworker) and common memberships/social position.

## Granovetter-Transitivity (g-transitivity)

Granovetter's theory builds upon the concept of g-transitivity, which has two main rules:

- Rule 1: If two people (A and B) are strongly connected, they are likely to have a lot of other friends in common. This means the subgraph of an ego's strongly tied neighbors tends to have a high density of connections.
- Rule 2: If person A has a strong tie with B, and B has a strong tie with C, then there should be *at least a weak tie* between A and C. In other words, if A is strongly connected to B and B is strongly connected to C, this suggests a good probability of an existing tie between A and C.

Reasons for g-transitivity include demographic similarity (homophily), shared **social foci** (e.g., participating in common activities or belonging to the same groups), and propinquity (physical closeness). Homophily, the tendency for people to connect with similar others, is a well-established finding in social science and can lead to more durable relations. Shared social foci, where actors participate in common activities, are a mechanism for context-driven link formation.

## The Weak Tie Principle

A central tenet of the strength of weak ties theory is Granovetter's **weak tie principle**, which states that weak ties allow for a violation of g-transitivity. This means that you do not necessarily have to be connected to every person who is connected to someone with whom you only have a weak tie. In ego networks, weak ties in an individual's "active network" [@dunbar14] are less likely to be connected to one another, leading to g-transitivity violations.

## Weak Ties as Bridges

The most significant insight of the theory is that weak ties frequently function as **bridges**, connecting an individual to parts of the social structure that they would not otherwise have access to through their strong ties. Particularly, weak ties allow the individual to *access novel Information*. Strong ties, due to g-transitivity, often lead to redundant information because "a friend of a friend is (likely to be) a friend". This implies that your close friends are likely to know the same information or have similar perspectives. Weak ties, however, provide access to novel and valuable information that your close friends might not possess. These bridging ties link parts of the network that would otherwise be disconnected, significantly reducing the average shortest path length in a graph and leading to rapid information transmission.

In this respect, the *absence* of weak ties implies several disadvantages:

- An individual will not have access to distant parts of the social system.
- Information tends to be localized.
- One is put at a disadvantage when novel information is valuable.
- At a broader social system level, an absence of weak ties can lead to fragmentation into disconnected communities characterized by strong tie clusters, making the diffusion of new ideas and global coordination difficult.

## Applications and Examples

The Strength of Weak Ties theory has profound implications for various social phenomena:

- *Social Mobility and Job Opportunities*: Finding new job opportunities and achieving social mobility often depends on accessing new information. Contacts with whom you are weakly connected are more likely to know something you don't, making weak ties valuable for uncovering new information and resources. For instance, research suggests that individuals engaging in a wide variety of cultural activities are more likely to find jobs through social contacts, particularly weak ties.
- *Diffusion of Innovations*: Weak ties are crucial for the rapid diffusion of certain types of information, such as gossip or disease (mainly via **simplex contagion**; see @sec-diffusion), across networks because they reduce average path lengths between disparate groups. Early adopters of innovations often acquire new ideas from media or weak ties, reflecting a "Local/Cosmopolitan split". Cosmopolitan innovators, in particular, are early adopters relative to the system and have very low thresholds for adoption due to their diverse weak ties. 

## The Diversity-Bandwidth Tradeoff Theory

The Diversity-Bandwidth Tradeoff Theory extends Granovetter's original argument by incorporating the temporal flow of information. While Granovetter's initial conception viewed tie properties in static terms, information transmission and access are dynamic processes. In the theory, the **bandwidth** of a tie refers to the rate at which information is transmitted. Weak ties typically transmit information at slower rates (less frequency), while strong ties transmit at higher rates (more frequency).  The Diversity-Bandwidth Tradeoff Theory posits that there is a fundamental tradeoff between the novelty/diversity of information obtained and the "bandwidth" of the tie.

- **Low Bandwidth** (Weak) Ties are more effective when contacts possess diverse pools of information (different people know different things). They are particularly suited for transmitting novel but "simple" information, such as "Who's hiring?" or "What's the best messaging app?".
- **High Bandwidth** (Strong) Ties excel at transmitting novel but complex or interdependent information, such as "How to do network analysis in R". High bandwidth ties offer more trust, intimacy, and cooperativeness, facilitate a better collective memory, and are more effective at creating new knowledge by bringing people together.

The advantage of low bandwidth ties diminishes if contacts provide homogeneous information or if there's significant overlap in information across contacts because they talk to one another. Strong, high-bandwidth ties become redundant in such cases, as they just provide the same information faster. Low bandwidth ties are only preferable when the information is relatively static and the contacts provide highly diverse knowledge. The Diversity-Bandwidth Tradeoff Theory revisions of Granovetter's Strength of Weak Ties theory suggest that channel bandwidth is positively associated with receiving more diverse and total non-redundant information. A broader topic space and a higher refresh rate also contribute to a more valuable channel bandwidth in providing access to novel information.

In summary, the Strength of Weak Ties theory highlights how seemingly less significant connections play a vital role in connecting disparate parts of a social network, facilitating the flow of diverse information, and providing unique opportunities that stronger, more redundant ties cannot offer.
