# Types of Ties in Social Networks {#sec-types}

Social networks are built upon various types of connections, known as ties or edges, which link individuals or "nodes" within the network. These ties are the fundamental units of social networks and can be classified sociologically and through graph theory, each revealing different properties and implications.

## Graph-Theoretic Classification of Ties

In **graph theory** ties (links or edges) in graphs are classified by their inherent directionality:

### Symmetric Tie 

A tie is symmetric if the existence of a tie between A and B logically and necessarily implies that B is tied to A. Examples include being siblings, members of the same club, or spending time together. Symmetric ties thus lack meaningful directionality.  These are represented by **undirected graphs**.

### Asymmetric Tie 

A ties is asymmetric if when we know that a tie exists from A to B, it is not a necessity for a tie to exist from B to A, though it can happen. Thus, asymmetric ties are inherently directional. They come in two flavors:

- **Reciprocal**: A tie is reciprocal when edges exist in both directions, indicating mutual interaction (e.g., "You like me and I like you," or both parties regularly email each other).
- **Non-Reciprocal**: A tie is non-reciprocal when an edge only goes in one direction (e.g., "You don't like me, but I like you," or "Said ignores Tom's Facebook friend request"). 

Asymmetric ties are represented by **directed graphs**.

### Antisymmetric Tie

A tie is anti-symmetric if when we know that a tie exists from A to B, it means B cannot by necessity be linked back to A in the same way. This often signifies a hierarchical or authority relationship. Examples include "Omar is Isaac's boss" or a parent-child relationship, whereby if you are something's parent, they cannot also be your parent (they are something else to you like a son or daughter).

## Sociological Classification of Social Ties

Network analysts typically use four main criteria to define when people are connected or have a social tie. These can be broadly categorized into **states** (static situations) and **events** (processes in time). **Similarities** and **Social Relations** are types of states and **Interactions** and **Flows** are types of Events

### Similarities

- Definition: People are connected by similarities if they share something in common.
- Examples: This includes co-location (being in the same spatial and temporal space, like living in the same neighborhood or spending time together), co-membership (belonging to the same clubs or groups), or sharing socio-demographic attributes (like gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, age, education, or social category). For instance, "Smriti is classmates with Emma" is an example of a similarity-based tie.
- Graph Theory Property: Ties based on similarities are necessarily **symmetric**. This means if A shares a similarity with B, then B inherently shares that same similarity with A. An **undirected graph** is typically used to represent such symmetric ties.

### Social Relations

- Definition: These ties involve people acknowledging one another through a culturally recognized label or having a positive or negative sentiment toward each other.
- Examples:
  - Kinship: Such as mother, father, sibling, or cousin.
  - Other Roles: Including friends, acquaintances, neighbors, business partners, coworkers, boss, supervisor, student, or competitor.
  - Affective: Involving feelings like liking, trusting, or hating someone.
  - Cognitive: Relates to knowing someone, knowing about someone, or perceiving them in a certain way (e.g., seeing someone as happy or harmed).
- Graph Property: Social relations can be symmetric (e.g., "A is friends with B, and B is friends with A"), antisymmetric (e.g., "Omar is Isaac's boss," where Isaac cannot be Omar's boss by definition, implying inequality or hierarchy), or asymmetric (e.g., liking/disliking).

### Social Interactions

- Definition: These ties describe when people regularly communicate or direct specific behaviors, whether positive or negative, toward one another.
- Examples: Calling, texting, zooming, citing, supporting, helping, advising, resource exchange, talking, fighting, bullying, or even sexual interactions. For example, "Jeff and Neil email each other at work".
- Graph Property: Interactions are necessarily asymmetric. However, asymmetric ties can be reciprocal (where edges go in both directions, indicating a mutual behavior like both liking each other or regularly exchanging emails) or non-reciprocal (where edges only go in one direction, like one person texting another without a reply).

### Flows

- Definition: Flows represent when something, like information, beliefs, or resources, is transmitted or passed along from one person to another.
- Examples: This includes the exchange of information, beliefs, personnel, or various resources. "Wikipedia references another website" is an example of an information flow.
- Graph Property: Similar to interactions, flows are necessarily asymmetric. They can be reciprocal or non-reciprocal depending on whether the flow is returned, and thus are represented by **directed graphs**.
