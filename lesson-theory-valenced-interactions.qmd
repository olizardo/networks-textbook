# Valenced Interactions {#sec-valenced}

In the study of social networks, understanding how positive and negative relationships manifest and influence network structure is crucial. These relationships are often referred to as **valenced interactions** or **valenced ties**. The idea of valence in a tie refers to a tie property, mainly that a particular link can be either *positive* or *negative*. 

As we saw in @sec-sbalance, a network incorporating these positive and negative sentiments can be represented using a **signed graph** featuring distinct sets of positive and negative links. For instance, "liking," "hating," "admiring," "loving," "bullying," and "fighting" are examples of interpersonal sentiments and interactions that represent valenced ties within an ego network. Liking, admiring, and loving are examples of ties with **positive valence**, while hating, bullying, and fighting are examples of ties with **negative valence**. Network analysts have developed several specific theories aiming to explain how individuals form and manage these valenced interactions in social networks.

## Karma Theory

The core idea behind Karma Theory is the direct reciprocation of valence of ties that the individual directs towards others. If a person consistently directs negative sentiments or acts rudely towards others without obvious provocation, observers are likely to respond to that person with negativity. Conversely, if someone is generally kind and projects positive sentiments towards others, others are likely to reciprocate that positivity by directing positive ties toward that person. Thus, the **directed** ties that you *receive* in a network are likely to be of the same valence (positive or negative) as the ones that you *send out* to others. This mirrors the ancient Indian idea of "Karma," whereby the world rewards or punishes you to match what you have put out into the world. 

For example, imagine a new student joining a school. If this student is observed being consistently mean or dismissive towards various classmates, Karma Theory predicts that other students, without necessarily having had a direct negative interaction with the new student themselves, will likely develop a negative sentiment towards them. Similarly, if the new student is seen being helpful and friendly to many, others will tend to feel positively towards them. This occurs without additional relational context, meaning the reciprocation is based on the observed outgoing valence of the individual's interactions. 

## Status Theory

Status Theory proposes that an individual's sentiment towards another person is influenced by how others in the network feel about that person. In essence, people tend to adopt the sentiments of their peers or other network members regarding a third party. In the theory, the valence of ties maps to status, such that individuals who receive lots of *positive* ties from others are *high* in status, while individuals who receive lots of *negative* ties from others are *low* in status. The theory describes a self-fulfilling or positive feedback process, such that high-status people tend to accumulate additional positive ties from newcomers, and low status people tend to accumulate additional negative ties.

Consider a situation in a new office environment. If a particular colleague is widely respected and liked by most of your team members, Status Theory suggests you are more likely to also develop a positive sentiment towards that colleague. This is regardless of your initial direct interactions with them. This alignment could be to fit in with the team or because you assume your team members' positive opinions are based on valid reasons. Both mechanisms lead to aligning one's sentiments with the prevailing valence of ties the alter receives from others in the network. Like Karma Theory, Status Theory emphasizes that these sentiment decisions are often driven by balancing dynamics within the larger network, not purely by individual affection.

## Solidarity Theory

Solidarity Theory predicts that people develop positive sentiments towards those who share a similar social position within the sentiment network and negative sentiments towards those who are in different structural positions as themselves. This theory focuses on the congruence or divergence of individuals' structural roles and received sentiments. Social position in the network is measured by the types of ties that an individual receives. People in high-status positions receive lots of positive ties (like in Status Theory) and people in low-status positions receive lots of negative attention from others. 

In Solidarity Theory, the shared social situation acts as a basis for affinity. If two individuals experience similar patterns of positive or negative sentiments from the rest of the network, by receiving lots of positive or negative ties from others, they are likely to form a positive bond with each other. Conversely, if their social positions or the sentiments they receive from others are divergent, they are likely to have a negative tie between them. 

Imagine two individuals who are consistently disliked by the majority of people in their social circle. Solidarity Theory suggests that these two "disliked" individuals would have a strong incentive to form a positive bond with each other. They recognize their shared, unfavorable position and can find solidarity in mutual support against the broader negativity. This explains for instance why in the context of high-schools individuals that are either on the receiving of negative interactions (such as teasing and bullying) tend to develop positive ties.  

Similarly, if two individuals are widely liked and popular within the network, they also share a similar social situation. According to Solidarity Theory, they would also have an incentive to like one another, reinforcing their shared positive standing and developing a popular "clique". However, if one person is consistently liked by others in the network, while another is consistently disliked, their differing social positions would lead to a predicted negative sentiment between them, as they belong to distinct status orders in the network.
