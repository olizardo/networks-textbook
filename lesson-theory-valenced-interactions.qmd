# Valenced Interactions {#sec-tbalance}

In the study of social networks, understanding how positive and negative relationships manifest and influence network structure is crucial. These relationships are often referred to as **valenced interactions** or **valenced ties**. The idea of valence in a tie refers to a tie property, mainly that a particular link can be either *positive* or *negative*. 

As we saw in @sec-sbalance, a network incorporating these positive and negative sentiments can be represented using a **signed graph** featuring distinct sets of positive and negative links. For instance, "liking," "trusting," and "acquaintanceship" are examples of interpersonal sentiments and cognitions that represent valenced ties within an ego network. Network analysts have developed several specific theories aiming to explain how individuals form and manage these valenced interactions in social networks.

## Karma Theory

Karma Theory posits that individuals tend to reciprocate the sentiments that someone expresses towards others. This theory suggests that our feelings towards an individual are influenced by the general "vibe" or pattern of sentiments that individual sends out into the network, so that you end up getting what you receive (e.g., what goes around networks, comes back around).

- *Mechanism*: The core idea in Karma Theory is the direct reciprocation of tie valence. If a person consistently directs negative sentiments or acts rudely towards others without obvious provocation, observers are likely to respond to that person with negativity. Conversely, if someone is generally kind and projects positive sentiments towards others, others are likely to reciprocate that positivity. Thus, the **directed** ties that you *receive* in a network are likely to be of the same valence (positive or negative) as the ones that you *send out* to others.

- *Example*: Imagine a new student joining a school. If this student is observed being consistently mean or dismissive towards various classmates, Karma Theory predicts that other students, without necessarily having had a direct negative interaction with the new student themselves, will likely develop a negative sentiment towards them. Similarly, if the new student is seen being helpful and friendly to many, others will tend to feel positively towards them. This occurs without additional relational context, meaning the reciprocation is based on the observed outgoing valence of the individual's interactions. This theory suggests that the decision to like or dislike an alter is driven by a form of generalized reciprocation based on their actions towards others, contributing to the overall balance of sentiments in the network.

## Status Theory

Status Theory proposes that an individual's sentiment towards another person (an "alter") is influenced by how others in the network feel about that same alter. In essence, people tend to adopt the sentiments of their peers or other network members regarding a third party. In the theory, the valence of ties maps to status, such that individuals who receive lots of *positive* ties are *high* in status, while individuals who receive lots of *negative* ties are *low* in status. The theory describes a self-fulfilling or positive feedback process, such that high-status people tend to accumulate additional positive ties, and low status people tend to accumulate additional negative ties.

- *Mechanism*: This theory offers two primary reasons for this spread of sentiments in the network:

  1. Balance and Conflict Avoidance: Individuals may seek to align their sentiments with those around them to avoid conflict or social tension. If everyone else likes someone, disliking that person might put you at odds with your existing social connections.
  2. Information Asymmetry: Others in the network might possess more information about the alter, and by mimicking their sentiments, an individual can benefit from this accumulated knowledge without having to gather it firsthand.

- *Example*: Consider a situation in a new office environment. If a particular colleague (the "alter") is widely respected and liked by most of your team members, Status Theory suggests you are more likely to also develop a positive sentiment towards that colleague. This is regardless of your initial direct interactions with them. This alignment could be to fit in with the team (balance) or because you assume your team members' positive opinions are based on valid reasons (information asymmetry). Both mechanisms lead to aligning one's sentiments with the prevailing valence of ties the alter receives from others in the network. Like Karma Theory, Status Theory emphasizes that these sentiment decisions are often driven by balancing dynamics within the larger network, not purely by individual affection.

## Solidarity Theory

Solidarity Theory predicts that people develop positive sentiments towards those who share a similar social position within the sentiment network and negative sentiments towards those who are in different structural positions as themselves. This theory focuses on the congruence or divergence of individuals' structural roles and received sentiments. Social position in the network is measured by the types of ties that an individual receives. People in high-status positions receive lots of positive ties (like in Status Theory) and people in low-status positions receive lots of negative attention from others. 

- *Mechanism*: The shared social situation acts as a basis for affinity. If two individuals experience similar patterns of positive or negative sentiments from the rest of the network, they are likely to form a positive bond with each other. Conversely, if their social positions or the sentiments they receive from others are different, a negative sentiment is predicted to form between them.

- *Example 1 (Shared Dislike)*: Imagine two individuals who are consistently disliked by the majority of people in their social circle. Solidarity Theory suggests that these two "disliked" individuals would have a strong incentive to form a positive bond with each other. They recognize their shared, unfavorable position and can find solidarity in mutual support against the broader negativity.

- *Example 2 (Shared Like)*: Similarly, if two individuals are widely liked and popular within the network, they also share a similar social situation. According to Solidarity Theory, they would also have an incentive to like one another, reinforcing their shared positive standing.

- *Example 3 (Divergent Sentiments)*: However, if one person is consistently liked by others in the network, while another is consistently disliked, their differing social positions would lead to a predicted negative sentiment between them. They lack the shared foundation for solidarity. 

Solidarity Theory, along with Karma and Status theories, contributes to the understanding that individuals' sentiments are reciprocated in ways that seek to maintain or achieve a state of balance within the existing relational structure of the network. The formation of these valenced ties is thus seen as a strategic response to the network environment rather than purely intrinsic feelings.
