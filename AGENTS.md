# Social Networks Textbook Agent Memory

## Project Overview
This repository contains the source code for an introductory textbook on social network analysis titled **"Social Networks: An Introduction"** by Omar Lizardo and Isaac Jilbert. It is structured and built as a Quarto book.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Quarto (Book project type)
- **Language:** R
- **Environment Management:** `renv` (R environment)
- **Build Output:** The public book site renders to `_sites/`
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) on `ubuntu-latest` deploying to GitHub Pages

## Project Structure
- `*.qmd`: Quarto markdown files containing the lessons. They follow a naming convention organized by topic:
  - `lesson-graphs-*.qmd`
  - `lesson-matrix-*.qmd`
  - `lesson-positions-*.qmd`
  - `lesson-sna-*.qmd`
  - `lesson-theory-*.qmd`
- `_quarto.yml`: Quarto configuration, detailing the book structure and chapters. Only chapters listed in `book: chapters:` are built into the textbook.
- `networks.bib`: Bibliography file containing references/citations for the textbook.
- `renv.lock` / `renv/`: R environment lockfile and project library.
- `slides/`: Reveal.js slide decks for course lectures. Rendered into `_sites/slides/` during publishing.
- `homeworks/`: Course homework source assignments (`homework{1..9}.qmd`). Rendered locally using `./render_homeworks.sh` and synced directly to UCLA Bruin Learn (Canvas LMS). Homeworks are explicitly excluded from public web publishing.
- `scraps/`: Drafts, retired chapters, and working fragments excluded from the book build.

## Core Workflows

### 1. Rendering the Textbook
- Run `quarto render` (or use IDE build tools).
- Quarto automatically renders only the chapters defined under `book: chapters:` in `_quarto.yml`.
- Render output is placed into `_sites/`.

### 2. Homework Authoring & Canvas LMS Sync
Homework assignments are delivered privately to students via UCLA Bruin Learn (Canvas LMS) rather than published on the open web:
1. **Edit assignment:** Modify `homeworks/homework{1..9}.qmd`.
2. **Render locally:** Run `./render_homeworks.sh [hw_number]`
   ```bash
   ./render_homeworks.sh 1       # Render Homework 1
   ./render_homeworks.sh         # Render all Homeworks (1-9)
   ```
   This generates `homeworks/homework{i}.html` and diagram figures in `homeworks/homework{i}_files/figure-html/`.
3. **Sync to Bruin Learn:** From the sibling repository (`../SOCIOL 111`):
   ```bash
   python3 sync_homeworks_to_canvas.py --dry-run --hw 1   # Preview changes
   python3 sync_homeworks_to_canvas.py --hw 1             # Push update live
   ```
   *Note:* The sync script automatically detects and reads from this local repository (`../networks-textbook`) for instant updates. Pass `--remote` to force fetching from GitHub if needed.
4. **Security & Privacy:** Homework assignments and answer keys must never be published to `_sites/` or exposed on the public site. The legacy numeric suffix hack (`*-5562048*`) and `render_homeworks.ps1` have been retired.

### 3. Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)
The `.github/workflows/publish.yml` pipeline runs on `ubuntu-latest` upon push to `main`:
1. **Pre-render Validation:**
   - `python check_book_refs.py`: Verifies that all active chapters listed in `_quarto.yml` have properly defined cross-references (figures, tables, sections, equations). Fails the build on broken refs.
   - `python check_book_citations.py`: Verifies that all bibliography citation keys used in active chapters exist in `networks.bib`. Fails the build on missing bib keys.
2. **Fast R Dependency Installation:** Uses `r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2` with Posit Public Package Manager (P3M) binary packages (`use-public-rspm: true`), completing dependency install in seconds.
3. **Book Build:** Renders book chapters to `_sites/`.
4. **Slide Decks Build:** Renders `slides/*.qmd` into `_sites/slides/`.
5. **Deployment:** Deploys `_sites/` to GitHub Pages.

## AI Agent Guidelines
- **Adding Chapters:** When creating a new chapter, use established file naming conventions and integrate the file into `_quarto.yml` under `book: chapters:`.
- **Canvas Assignment Links:** When lessons conclude a topic with an associated homework, include a callout tip pointing students to the specific assignment on Bruin Learn (`::: {.callout-tip} ## Associated Assignment on Bruin Learn ... :::`).
- **Slide Image References:** Slide decks in `slides/` must reference root images as `../images/<filename>`. Root `images/` is registered under `project.resources` in `_quarto.yml` to guarantee availability on the deployed site.
- **R Code Execution:** Before running complex operations, ensure the active R environment has necessary packages loaded (`renv::restore()`).
- **Context:** This is an educational resource. Explanations of code, concepts, and network theory should be clear and accessible for students.
