    "text": "19.1 Bipartite Graphs\nA bipartite graph is useful to represent a network where, rather than ties occurring between nodes of the same kind (e.g., people connected with other people), ties occur only between nodes of different kinds but never between nodes of the same kind. Typically, the two different types of nodes are located at different levels of analysis or aggregation. As such, bipartite graphs are perfect for capturing the sociological concept of affiliation or membership with larger groups or events (Breiger 1974). For instance, actors and the movies they make, scientists and the papers they write, or people and the groups they belong to.1\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.1: A bipartite graph. Circles are people and triangles are the corporate boards they belong to\n\n\n\n\nFor example, people work at companies, so we might say that a worker is connected with the company, rather than any specific individual there. People also connect to sports teams, schools, religious communities, and other organizations which can have an influence in structuring their social world.\nIn the graph theoretic sense, a bipartite graph \\(G_B\\) is a graph featuring two sets of nodes \\(V_1\\) and \\(V_2\\) and one set of edges \\(E\\). Thus a bipartite graph, like a signed and a weighted graph, is a set of three sets:\n\\[\n    G_B = (E, V_1, V_2)\n\\tag{19.1}\\]\n\nrepresents a network diagram of a bipartite graph where circles connect to triangles (with the shapes standing as labels for the two set of nodes). In the Figure, \\(V_1 = \\{A, B, C, D, E\\}\\) and \\(V_2 = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}\\). The edge set \\(E\\) is \\(\\{A1, A2, B2, B3, C2, C4, D4, D3, E3, E5\\}\\).\n\nOne common example of two-mode networks that be represented using bipartite graphs in sociology are corporate interlock networks (Mizruchi 1983). If 1) represented such a network, we could think of the circles as members of the company’s board, and the triangles are the board from each company. Because the same executive can be a member of more than one company’s board, board member A is on the board of both companies 1 and 2, while board member B is on the board of companies 2 and 3.\nNote that edges in a bipartite graph are symmetrical and thus bipartite graphs are (generally) undirected. This makes sense, since the relationship affiliation or membership is indeed symmetrical by definition. If person A is a member of the board in company 2 then it is understood that company 2 has person A as a board member.\nIn the same way, note that there is no reason why the cardinality of two node sets in a bipartite graph have to be same (although they are in the example provided). In a real world corporate interlock network, for instance, there will generally be more people than companies, so \\(|V_1| > |V_2|\\)."

    "text": "19.2 Unipartite Projections of Bipartite Graphs\nWhile the information we can glean from looking at the original bipartite graph alone may be useful, you might realize that board members A and B both are on the boards of company 2! In fact, board member C is also on the board of company 2! We might thus conclude that board members A, B, and C all know each other from sitting in the same company board.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.2: A unipartite graph. People are linked if they serve in the same company board\n\n\n\n\nIf this sort of information was important, we could convert the bipartite into a simple unipartite graph capturing connections between the same level of analysis. This is called a projection of the original bipartite graph. In the projected graph, two board members are joined by a symmetric tie if they both serve on the board of at least one company together.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.3: Another unipartite graph. Boards are linked if they share members.\n\n\n\n\nThus, we could, as shown in Figure 19.2, create a graph that shows board members who know each other because they work at the same company. The resulting (simple, undirected) graph shows that board members A, B, and C all know each other as a result of serving in the board of company 2 together.\nLikewise, we can transform the bipartite graph into a simple unipartite graph that captures companies that share board members. Company 2 is thus connected to Companies 1 (because of person A), 3 (because of person B), and 4 (because of person 5). This is shown in Figure 19.3). In fact, the reason why these are called interlock networks, is because it is easy to see that, ultimately, by virtue of sharing members across boards, most big corporations in the U.S. (and other countries), end up forming part of a single giant network."

    "text": "19.3 From Biparite Graph to Affiliation Matrix\nConsider the two-mode network shown in Figure 19.4. This is an affiliation network meant to represent the memberships of six students in five college activity clubs. As discussed earlier, we use a bipartite graph to represent the network. The bipartite graph represents the two sets of nodes using different shapes or colors (blue and red nodes in Figure 19.4), and draws a link between the people and the group if the person is affiliated with the group.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.4: Bipartite graph of a two-mode network of students and clubs.\n\n\n\n\nHow can we translate the graph representation into a matrix?\nThe procedure is the same as that used to build the adjacency matrix of the symmetric graph. We build a rectangular matrix whose number of rows is the same as the number of people in the affiliation network, and whose number of rows is the same as the number of groups. The matrix is rectangular (as opposed to square) because in a two-mode network, there is no restriction that the size of the two vertex sets be the same (although if they happen to be the same then you end up with a square matrix; after all, a square is a special case of a rectangle!).\nIn graph theory terms, this is a matrix that we call A, for affiliation matrix of dimensions \\(R \\times C\\), where the number of rows \\(R = |V_1|\\) is the cardinality of the first vertex set in the bipartite graph (persons in Figure 19.4), and where the number of rows \\(C = |V_2|\\) is the cardinality of the second vertex set (clubs in Figure 19.4)). The cells of the affiliation matrix, \\(a_{ij} = 1\\) if person i belongs to club j (there’s an symmetric edge in the graph linking the person to the group), otherwise, \\(a_{ij} = 0\\).\nFollowing these instructions would yield the affiliation matrix shown in Table 19.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFashion\nNerdfighters\nMagic\nSuper Smash Brs.\nCheese\n\n\n\n\nGabriela\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n\nParker\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nBrandon\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n\nMarie\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n\nRahul\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\n\nMinjoo\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\n\n\nTable 19.1: Affiliation matrix of a bipartite graph.\n\n\nThe affiliation matrix has some interesting properties. For instance, just like the adjacency matrix, it can be used to compute node degree centrality for each set of nodes. But since we have two different sets of nodes, we end up with two different sets of centrality scores; one set of centrality scores for the people and another set for the groups (Faust 1997).\nLet us see how this works."

Other people, (like Minjoo), just have a single interest, and thus join only one club (the Cheese Club). If centrality is defined using the “more/more principle” discussed in lesson on centrality, then we would say that Gabriela is more central than Minjoo in the affiliation network.\n\n\n19.4.2 Group Centralities\nIn the same way, if wanted to compute the degree centralities of other mode (the club node set, abbreviated as G), then we would calculate the column sums of the affiliation matrix using a slight variation of Equation 19.2), like we did when we switched from outdegree to indegree:\n\\[\n    C_G^{DEG} = \\sum_i a_{ij}\n\\tag{19.3}\\]\nWhich leads to the following degree centrality scores for the clubs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFashion\nNerdfighters\nMagic\nSuper Smash Brs.\nCheese\n\n\n\n\n2\n3\n4\n3\n2\n\n\n\nTable 19.3: Degree centrality scores for the clubs.\n\n\nJust like the people, the centrality scores for the clubs tell us something about the popularity of each group.

The Cheese and Fashion Clubs on the other hand, seem to be more niche pursuits, with only two members each."

If we used equations Equation 19.2, and Equation 19.3) to compute the person and group centralities using the affiliation matrix transpose A’, we would get the same results, except that the first equation (summing across the rows) would now give us the group centralities, and the second equation (summing down the columns) would give use the people centralities!\nWe learn from matrix algebra that an important property of rectangular matrices is that you can always multiply a rectangular matrix by its transpose (see Section 16.4.1). Recall a key condition of matrix multiplication is that the two matrices be conformable so that the columns of the first matrix need to match the number of rows of the second matrix. Well, it’s clear than since any matrix that is of dimensions \\(R \\times C\\), will have a transpose of dimensions \\(C \\times A\\) then the multiplication of the two matrices will be defined:\n\\[\n    A^{}_{R \\times C} \\times A^{'}_{C \\times R} = defined!\n\\tag{19.4}\\]\nIn the same way, the transpose of a matrix can always be multipled by the original matrix:\n\\[\n    A^{'}_{C \\times R} \\times A^{}_{R \\times C} = defined!\n\\tag{19.5}\\]"

    "text": "19.6 The Person and Group Overlap Matrices\nIf the transpose of the affiliation matrix contains the same information as the original why do we care about it? Well the reason is that we can use the multiplication property described in Section 16.4.2 to extract two new matrices that contain new (or at least not obvious, especially for large two-mode networks), information from the original affiliation matrix. The first is called the person overlap matrix (written \\(O^P\\)), this is defined for an original affiliation matrix, in which people are listed in the rows and groups, events, or project, listed in the columns using the following matrix equation:\n\\[\n    O^P = A^{ }_{R \\times C} \\times A^{'}_{C \\times R}\n\\tag{19.6}\\]\n\n19.6.1 The Person Overlap Matrix\nUsing the rules for matrix multiplication discussed Section 16.4.1, the person overlap matrix obtained using the affiliation matrix shown in Table 19.1 is shown in Table 19.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGabriela\nParker\nBrandon\nMarie\nRahul\nMinjoo\n\n\n\n\nGabriela\n4\n2\n3\n1\n2\n0\n\n\nParker\n2\n2\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nBrandon\n3\n1\n3\n1\n2\n0\n\n\nMarie\n1\n1\n1\n2\n0\n1\n\n\nRahul\n2\n0\n2\n0\n2\n0\n\n\nMinjoo\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n\nTable 19.5: Person Overlap Matrix.\n\n\nThe person overlap matrix transforms the initial rectangular affiliation matrix, which has people in the rows and groups in the columns, to a square matrix, which like the usual relationship matrices we have been dealing with, feature people in both the rows and the columns. Each entry in the person overlap matrix \\(o^P_{ij}\\) now gives us the number of groups in which person i and j mutually belong to (Breiger 1974). So we learn that Gabriela and Brandon have three memberships in common (I bet they seen another a lot!) but that Rahul and Parker have no memberships in common (so they are less likely to encounter one another).\nNote also that, in the person overlap matrix, (in contrast to the usual adjacency matrix), there are valid entries along the diagonal cells (\\(o^P_{ii}\\)). These cells now record the total number of memberships that the node corresponding to that row (or column) has. Which we ascertained by computing the node centralities in the original affiliation matrix using Equation 19.2). You can see that the vector of degree centralities shown in Table 19.2) is the same as the vector formed by the diagonal entries in ?tbl-comem).\n\n\n19.6.2 The Group Overlap Matrix\nIn the same way we can compute the person overlap matrix, it is possible to calculate another matrix, called the group overlap matrix (written \\(O^G\\)), this time by multiplying the transpose of the original affiliation matrix times the original We do that using the following equation:\n\\[\n    O^G = A^{'}_{C \\times R} \\times A^{ }_{R \\times C}\n\\tag{19.7}\\]\nRecall from Section 16.4 that matrix multiplication is not commutative (if \\(A\\) is a rectangular matrix, then \\(A \\times A^{'} \\neq A^{'} \\times A\\))), so Equation 19.7 gives you a different answer than Equation 19.6. The result is shown in Table 19.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFashion\nNerdfighters\nMagic\nSuper Smash Brs.\nCheese\n\n\n\n\nFashion\n2\n1\n2\n1\n0\n\n\nNerdfighters\n1\n3\n2\n3\n0\n\n\nMagic\n2\n2\n4\n2\n1\n\n\nSuper Smash Brs.\n1\n3\n2\n3\n0\n\n\nCheese\n0\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n\n\nTable 19.6: Group Overlap Matrix.\n\n\nThe group overlap matrix (O), like the person overlap matrix, is also square. But this time it has groups in both the rows and columns. Each cell in the group overlap matrix \\(o^P_{ij}\\) records the number of people groups i and groups j have in common (Breiger 1974). Thus, we learn that the Super Smash Brothers group and the Nerdfighters groups share three members in common but that the Super Smash Brothers and the Cheese group have no members in common (pointing to a disaffinity between these activities).\nNote that both the person and group overlap matrices are symmetric. It is easy to see why this is; if I have three group overlaps with you, then you by definition also have three group overlaps with me; if group A has three members in common with group B, then group B has three members in common with group A. This means that if they were to be taken as representing a network, then the resulting graph would be undirected (but weighted because there can be more or less overlap between people and groups). We will see how to do that below."

In a two-mode network if a node belong to one of the vertex sets, let’s say \\(V_1\\), then all of their neighbors have to belong to the other vertex set (\\(V_2\\)) and vice versa.\nFor instance, in Figure 19.4), Gabriela’s node neighborhood is:\n\\[\n    Gab_{NN} = \\{Fashion, Nerdfighters, Magic, SuperSmashBros\\}\n\\]\nRahul’s node neiborhood is:\n\\[\n    Rah_{NN} = \\{Nerdfighters, SuperSmashBros\\}\n\\]\nThe intersection between their neighborhoods is:\n\\[\n    Gab_{NN} \\cap Rah_{NN} = \\{Nerdfighters, SuperSmashBros\\}\n\\]\nSo now we can see that the number “2” recorded in the cell that corresponds to Gabriela and Rahul in the person overlap matrix shown in Table 19.5) is the cardinality of the subset formed by the intersection of their two neighborhoods, which in this case contain two members (the Nerdfighters and Super Smash Brothers clubs). The same procedure can be used to figure out the overlap between the node neighborhoods of groups (which happen to be subsets of people in the larger two-mode network)."

Each two-mode network thus has two one mode projection one for each node set.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.6: One mode (groups) projection of the original bipartite graph.\n\n\n\n\nThe one mode projection for the person node set of the bipartite graph show in Figure 19.4) is shown in Figure 19.5), this is an undirected weighted graph with the edge weight between people being set to the number of comemberships between each dyad as recorded in the person overlap matrix shown in Table 19.5). In this respect, the number of comemberships can be seen as a proxy of the tie strength between two people, when we only have information on their affiliations. As the Figure shows, Brandon, Gabriela and Rahul form a tightly connected clique, given the number of memberships they share. Minjoo, who does not share many affiliations with anyone, stands toward the periphery of the person-to-person comembership network.\nThe corresponding one-mode projection for the group node set is shown in Figure 19.6). This weighted graph can be read the same way: The thickness of the ties between groups are proportion to the people they share as recorded in the group overlap matrix shown in Table 19.6), thus speaking to the similarity or strength of connectivity between groups.\nSo we see, as we noted before, that Super Smash Brothers and Nerdfighters are tightly connected, but that the Cheese Club is largely peripheral in the group-to-group network. This peripheral status mirrors the marginal status of Minjoo (one of the few members of the Cheese Club) in the person-to-person network.\nThe fact that peripheral people belong peripheral groups and central people belong to central groups encodes a fundamental principle in the analysis of two-mode networks (Breiger 1974) and that is the duality principle.\nThe duality principle in two-mode network analysis says that the position of people in a two-mode network is defined by the positions the groups they affiliate with occupy, and in the same way, the position of the groups in a two-mode network is defined by the positions of the people that belong to them (Bonacich 1991)."

    "section": "8.1 Symmetric Ties and Undirected Graphs",
    "text": "8.1 Symmetric Ties and Undirected Graphs\nNodes and edges are indeed the building blocks of a graph. However, types of relationships that the edges represent can change both how we understand the network conceptually and also what mathematical techniques we can apply to the graph when we compute graph metrics (the subject of Chapter 5). The basic idea is that when we do network analysis, we want to map our understanding of the nature of the social relationships we are studying to the types of graphs we use to represent the network formed by the concatenation of those relationships (Martin 2009).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: A undirected graph\n\n\n\n\nLet us assume that Figure 8.1 represents a network of people who spend time together. One way of building this network would be to ask people on your dorm room floor who are the people that they spend some amount of time (e.g., more than an hour a week) hanging out with. By definition the relation “spending time together” lacks any inherent directionality. Mutuality (or reciprocity) is built in by construction. It would be nonsensical for a person (say A) to claim that they spend time with another person (say B) and for B to say that they do not spend time with A. In social network analysis these types of ties are called symmetric ties (Heider 1946). So if \\(AB\\) means that A spends time with B if we know \\(AB\\) is true, then we know that \\(BA\\) is also true.\nIn the same way, two people being in the same place at the same time (co-location), even if they do not one another, is an example of a symmetric tie. You also have the symmetric tie “being in the same class as” every other student that is also taking your Social Networks seminar this term. Note that, in this sense, all co-memberships create symmetric ties among all actors involved (we will revisit this topic when talking about affiliation networks in Chapter 19). For instance, if I am a member of your family, you are also my family member; if we are both members of the soccer club, we are considered teammates.\nSocial networks composed of symmetric ties are represented using undirected graphs like the one shown in Figure 8.1. When an undirected graph has no loops (edges connecting a node to itself), and there is only one edge connecting adjacent vertices to one another (the graph has no multiedges), it is called a simple undirected graph.\nNetworks composed of symmetric ties have some interesting properties. If we know that the relationship (R) linking two nodes A and B is symmetric, then only a single edge exists that links them, and it does not matter whether we call this edge AB or BA. The order does not matter. In this way, we can formally define as symmetric tie as one that lacks directionality; if a tie is symmetric, then if we know that A is related to B (the AB edge is part of the edge set of the graph), then we know by necessity that B is related to A.\nCan you think of other examples of symmetric ties? Is friendship, as culturally defined in the contemporary world, a symmetric tie?"

    "text": "8.2 Asymmetric Ties and Directed Graphs\nIn contrast to spending time together, being members of the same family, or being in the same place at the same time, some social ties allow for inherent directionality. Edges in these graphs are are called asymmetric ties (Heider 1946). That is, one member of the pair can claim to have a particular type of social relationship with the other, but it is possible (although not necessary) that the other person fails to have the same relationship with the first.\nHelping or social support relations, are like this. For instance, you can help someone with their homework, or given them personal advice, but this does not necessarily mean that that person will return the favor. They may, or they may not. The point is that, in contrast to symmetric tie, mutuality or reciprocity is not built in by definition, but must happen as an empirical event in the world. We need to ask the other person to find out (or check their email logs). Can you think of other examples of asymmetric social ties?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: A directed graph\n\n\n\n\nReciprocity is an important concept in social network analysis. Some have said it is perhaps the most important concept for understanding human society (Gouldner 1960), which may be a bit of an exaggeration. Only asymmetric ties may have the property of being non-reciprocal or having more or less reciprocity. If I think you are my friend, I very much hope that you also think you are my friend.\nThat said, sociologists have found that in many natural social settings this is not the case. Sometimes people think they are friends with others, but those other people disagree (Carley and Krackhardt 1996). For this reason, sociologists typically ask: if I do you a favor, would you do me a favor in the future? Additionally, sociologists often ask: if I treat you with respect, will you also treat me with respect? If I text you, will you text me back? If this is true, we have a level of reciprocity in our relationship.\nFor some ties, such advice or support, or friendship relations, reciprocity is all or none; it either exists or it does not. For instance, the friendship offer you extend to someone may be reciprocated (or not). In the same way, you can like someone and they may like you back (or not), like the notes you passed around in middle school. For other ties, such as communication ties (e.g., those defined by the amount of texting, or calling), reciprocity is a matter of degree, there may be more or less. For instance, you can text someone 10 times a day, but they may text you back only half of those instances. In all cases, reciprocity is at a maximum when the content of the relationship is equally exchanged between actors.\nCan you think of relationships in your life characterized by more or less reciprocity?\nJust like symmetric ties are represented using a particular type of graph (namely, an undirected graph), social networks composed of asymmetric ties are best represented by a type of graph called a directed graph (or digraphs for short). Figure 8.2 shows the point and line diagram picture of a digraph. What were simple lines for in the undirected graph shown in Figure 8.1 have been replaced with arrows indicating directionality.\nA node sends a relationship to the node that the arrow points to, which in turn receives the relationship. In a digraph, up to two directed arrows may link nodes going in both directions. When an undirected graph has no loops (edges connecting a node to itself), and there is only one edge connecting a sender node to a receiving node (the graph has no multiedges) like Figure 8.2, it is called a simple directed graph.\nIn a directed graph, for every edge, there is a source node and a destination node. So in the case of “A helps B” the source node is A and the destination node is B. In the case of “B helps A” the source node is B and the destination node is A. This means that in a directed graph, in contrast to a undirected one, the order in which you list the nodes when you name the edges matters. Thus, the edge AB is a different one from the edge BA. The first one may exist but the second one may not exist (edges in a directed graph are sometimes also called arcs).\nFor instance, if Figure 8.2 were an advice network (Cross, Borgatti, and Parker 2001), on the other hand, we could say that H seeks advice from D, but D does not seek advice from H. This may be because D is higher in the office hierarchy or is more experienced than H, in which case lack of reciprocity may be indicative of an authority relationship between the two nodes.\nOne must always be careful when examining a directed network to make sure one properly understands the direction of the underlying social relationships!\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: A symmetric directed graph\n\n\n\n\nThere are also some special types of directed graphs. For instance, if in directed graph, every pair of adjacent nodes is connected via a bi-directional, reciprocal relationship, as in Figure 8.3, then it is called as symmetric directed graph.\n\n8.2.1 Node Neighborhoods in Directed Graphs\nJust like in undirected (simple) graphs, each node in a directed graph has a node neighborhood. However, because now each node can be the source or destination for a asymmetric edges, this means that we have to differentiate the neighborhood of a node depending on whether the node is the sender or the recipient of a given link.\nSo, we say that a node j is an an in-neighbor of a node i if there is a directed link with j as the source and i as the destination node. For instance, in Figure 8.2, E is an in-neighbor of C, because there’s a asymmetric edge with E as the source and C as the destination.\nIn the same way, we say that a node i is an out-neighbor of a node j if there is a directed link with i as the source and j as the destination. For instance, in Figure 8.2, F is an in-neighbor of G, because there’s a asymmetric edge with G as the source and F as the destination\nFor each node, the full set of in-neighbors forms the in-neighborhood of that node. This is written \\(N^{in}(v)\\), where \\(v\\) is the label corresponding to the node. For instance, in Figure 8.2, the node set \\(N^{in}(D) = \\{B, E, G\\}\\) is the in-neighborhood of node D.\nIn the same way, the full set of in-neighbors defines the out-neighborhood of that node. This is written \\(N^{out}(v)\\), where \\(v\\) is the label corresponding to the node. For instance, in Figure 8.2, the node set \\(N^{out}(B) = \\{A, C, D\\}\\) is the out-neighborhood of node B.\nNote that typically, the set of in-neighbors and out-neighbors of a given node will not be exactly the same, and sometimes the two sets will be completely disjoint (they won’t share any members).\nNodes will only show up in both the in and out-neighborhood set when there are reciprocal or mutual ties between the nodes. For instance, in Figure 8.2, the out-neighborhood of node F is \\(\\{A\\}\\) and the in-neighborhood is \\(\\{A, G\\}\\). Here node A shows up in both the in and out-neighborhood sets because A has a reciprocal tie with F.\n\n\n8.2.2 Node Degree in Directed Graphs\nBecause in a directed graph, each node has two distinct set of neighbors, we can compute two versions of degree for the same node.\n\nin a directed graph, for any node i, we can count the number of edges that have a given node \\(v\\) as their destination node. This is also the cardinality of the in-neighborhood set of that node. This is called a node’s indegree and it is written \\(k^{in}_i\\), where i is the label corresponding to that node.\nAdditionally, in a directed graph, for any node i, we can count the number of edges that have a given node \\(i\\) as their source node. This is also the cardinality of the out-neighborhood set of that node. This is called that node’s outdegree and it is written as \\(k^{out}_i\\), , where i is the label corresponding to that node.\n\nFor instance, in Figure 8.2, \\(k^{out}_B = 3\\) and \\(k^{in}_B = 2\\). Node B has three outgoing ties (from nodes A, C, and D) and three incoming ties (from nodes A and D).\nCan you calculate what the indegree and outdegree of node D in Figure 8.2 is?\nThe graph theoretic ideas of indegree and outdegree have clear sociological interpretations. In a social network, for instance, a node having a large outdegree could indicate a sociable person (a person that likes to connect with others), while having a large indegree can indicate a popular person (e.g., a person lots of other people want to be friends with). In a later lesson we will see how to use a directed graph’s asymmetric adjacency matrix to readily compute the outdegree and indegree in real social networks.\n\n\n8.2.3 Functional Graphs\nThere is a special kind of digraph that is built by imposing the restriction that each node can only have a single out-neighbor, meaning that the outdegree of each node is equal to one. This is called a functional graph and has applications in the anthropological analysis of kinship exchange systems in less differentiated societies. For instance, ?fig-fund\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: A symmetric directed graph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.4 Types of Nodes in Directed Graphs\nIn a directed graph, there will typically be three types of (non-isolate) nodes (Harary, Norman, and Cartwright 1965):\n\nFirst, there will be nodes that receive ties but don’t send them. These are called receivers (like node C in Figure 8.2). For receiver nodes \\(k_{in} > 0\\) and \\(k_{out} = 0\\).\nSecond, there will be nodes that receive ties and also send out ties. These are called carriers (like nodes A and B in Figure 8.2. For carrier nodes, \\(k_{in} > 0\\) and \\(k_{out} > 0\\).\nFinally, there will be nodes that send ties but don’t receive them. These are called transmitters (like nodes E and G in Figure 8.2). For transmitter nodes, \\(k_{in} = 0\\) and \\(k_{out} > 0\\)."

    "text": "8.3 Anti-Symmetric Ties and Oriented Graphs\nThere is a particular type of directed relationship that has the property of only going in one direction. These are called anti-symmetric ties. Like asymmetric ties, anti-symmetric ties have a directionality (and thus source and destination nodes), but reciprocity is forbidden by definition. That means that if A is anti-symmetrically connected to B, then B cannot send the same type of tie back to A (although B may be connected, and typically is, to A via some other type of tie in a different network).\nA common example of anti-symmetric ties in political sociology are patron-client ties (Martin 2009). Patrons can have many clients, but it is impossible for client of a patron to also be a patron to the same person. Other types of anti-symmetric ties include authority relations such as hierarchical ties at work, or cross-generational relations like kinship ties in families.\nIn the first (authority relations) case, your boss is your boss, while you cannot be your boss’ boss. The same goes for armies and other command and control structures, giving orders to is an anti-symmetric relation. An officer who gives orders to another officer (and thus commands them) cannot by definition also receive orders from them. Thus, Figure 8.7 could be a network in which the anti-symmetric links are directed “gives orders to” (in an army or an office) relations, where the source node directs commands toward the destination node. So A is the top boss and commands B, C, and D. Node B, in their turn, gives orders to E, who is at the lowest level of the command and control structure, not commanding anybody in turn.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.5: An oriented directed graph\n\n\n\n\nIn the second (cross-generational) case, your parents are your parents (but you can only be a son or daughter to your parents), and your grandparents are their parents, and so forth. “Being the parent of” thus counts as an anti-symmetric relation as we define here; it only goes way (from parents to children) but it cannot come back from children towards parents. Teacher-student, coach-athlete, buyer-seller, parent-child are all examples of anti-symmetric relationships that can be depicted as tree graphs.\nYet another set of relations that can only be represented using anti-symmetric links are dominance relations. These include negative interactions like “bullying”—or “pecking” if we are talking about chickens Chase (1982). Obviously if somebody bullies somebody else then they cannot be bullied back at the same time (although it could happen that a person dominated by a bully can become dominated by the person they used to bully, as when George McFly stood up to Biff in Back to the Future, thus reversing the direction of the one-way anti-symmetric link going from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) so that it goes from \\(B\\) to \\(A\\)).1\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.6: An oriented directed graph drawn as a tree.\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if we build a network composed of pure anti-symmetric ties? The resulting graph is a special type of directed graph called an oriented graph, like the one in Figure 8.5. An oriented graph is kind of the opposite of the kind of symmetric directed graph depicted in Figure 8.3. Whereas in Figure 8.3 every connected dyad is linked by a bi-directional reciprocal link, in the oriented graph shown in Figure 8.5, every connected dyad is linked only by a one-way non-reciprocal link, the link that would turn the asymmetrically connected dyads in Figure 8.5 into a reciprocal dyad is forbidden by the nature of the tie.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.7: A tree graph with thirteen nodes.\n\n\n\n\nAs we will see in Chapter 7, when considering connections between people that involve intermediaries, there is a special pattern called a cycle. This involves a node sending a directed tie to another node, which sends a directed tie to a third node. What makes it a cycle is that third node then sends a directed tie to the first node we began with. Recall from ?sec-dirtriads, that the three-person subgraph AAA(C) shown in ?fig-AAAC forms a cycle. For instance, in Figure 8.5, the sequence of directed edges \\(ED, DG, GE\\) forms a cycle starting and ending in node \\(E\\). Can you spot any other cycles in Figure 8.5?\nOne feature of a network composed of only anti-symmetric relations is that its corresponding graph can always be drawn from top to bottom, starting (at the top) with the node that only sends but does receive any ties and ending (at the bottom) with nodes that only receive, but do not send, ties. This is called a tree layout. For instance, Figure 8.6 shows the same graph as in Figure 8.5, but laid out as a tree.\nFor instance, if Figure 8.6 was a network composed of dominance interactions between people like “bullying” or “beating in a fight,” then the tree layout of the oriented graph would reveal the relevant dominance hierarchy between people. So we would conclude that node \\(D\\) being a transmitter node as defined in Section 8.2.4, that is, a node that is not the receiver of any dominance interactions but only a sender of them, is the “strongest.” No one dominates \\(D\\).\nNote that if you are dominated by somebody else in a dominance hierarchy, while you may not be able to dominate the person who dominates you back (given the anti-symmetric constraint), you can always dominate somebody else. This dynamic creates chains of negative interactions, which is exactly how bullying networks work when observed by sociologists.\nThus, in Figure 8.6, while \\(C\\) gets dominated by \\(D\\), they in turn bully \\(F\\) and \\(E\\). This creates dominance chains—technically known as a directed paths as we will see in Chapter 13—going from \\(A\\) to \\(C\\) to \\(F\\) and \\(E\\). Also note that in a dominance hierarchy, transmitter nodes like \\(\\{A, B, C, G\\}\\) in Figure 8.6 are both bullies and bullied, while receiver nodes are in the worst possible position only receiving negative interactions."
