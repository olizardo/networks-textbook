    "text": "33.1 Why Triads are Special: Simmel’s Model\nSimmel’s model highlights crucial differences between two-person and three-person groups that contribute to the persistence of Simmelian ties:\n\n33.1.1 Individuality and Conformity\nIn a standalone dyad, individuals tend to maintain more individuality. There’s less external pressure on either person to compromise or conform to a third party’s views. In contrast, a dyad embedded in a triad (forming Simmelian ties) experiences greater pressure to conform to the views of others. Any individual member within a triad can be “outvoted” by the other two, which can lead to less individuality and autonomy. This external social pressure helps stabilize the relationships within the triad.\n\n\n33.1.2 Conflict Resolution\nStandalone dyads have a greater potential for unresolved differences. Conflict is often more difficult to settle because there is no neutral third party to mediate. If one person withdraws, the relationship dissolves, indicating a “power-symmetric” dynamic. In triads, there is more potential for conflict resolution. A dispute between two members can be mediated or arbitrated by the third member. Research supports that third parties are useful in alleviating dyadic conflicts. This inherent mechanism for conflict resolution makes the ties within a triad more resilient.\nConsider a friendship triad involving Alice, Bob, and Charlie. If Alice and Bob have a strong friendship (a Simmelian tie because it’s part of a closed triangle with Charlie), and they have a disagreement, Charlie can step in to mediate. This mediation by a third party helps resolve the conflict and preserve the tie between Alice and Bob, making it more likely to persist than if their friendship existed in isolation.\n\n\n33.1.3 Durability and Strength\nSimmelian Tie Theory predicts that Simmelian ties are stronger, last longer, and are harder to break than non-Simmelian ties. They exhibit greater durability and resistance to disruption. This is a direct consequence of the “top-down” effects triads have on the dyads that compose them, where all actors work together to keep ties from dissolving. This means they are less likely to decay or disappear over time. They also have a lower “liability of newness” which refers to the tendency of social ties to decay early on in the formation process.\nSimmelian ties are specifically described as symmetric, strong, and embedded. In this sense according to Simmelian Tie Theory, ties are strong because they are embedded in triads; strength is a result of embeddedness, not a cause of it as in Granovetter’s Strength of Weak Ties Theory (see Chapter 31)."

    "text": "33.2 Examples of Simmelian Ties\nSimmelian ties are not a distinct type of relationship in themselves (like “friend” or “coworker”) but rather describe the structural property and quality of ties when they are embedded within a strong, cohesive three-person group. Here are some examples:\nClose-knit friend groups.- A classic example arises when three friends (Person A, Person B, and Person C) are all strongly connected to each other. If Person A and Person B have a strong, reciprocal tie, and Person C also shares strong, reciprocal ties with both A and B, these interconnections form a closed triad. The ties between A-B, A-C, and B-C, being strong and mutually reinforcing within this small group, would be considered Simmelian. This aligns with Granovetter’s (1973) g-transitivity concept (see Chapter 31), where strong connections between two people imply they are likely to have other friends in common.\nFamily units.- Although kin ties can be symmetric (like siblings) or antisymmetric (like parent-child) based on role relations, if three family members form a highly interdependent and mutually supportive unit, the ties among them within that specific triadic structure would exhibit Simmelian qualities. For instance, two parents and a child who consistently provide emotional support, engage in frequent interactions, and mutually confide in one another would form a Simmelian triad, making their relational ties Simmelian.\nCore members of a small, collaborative team.- In a professional setting, if three individuals (e.g., co-founders, key project leaders) form a highly collaborative group with deep mutual trust, frequent interaction, and shared interests (homophily), their ties can become Simmelian. These “high bandwidth ties” (Aral and Van Alstyne 2011) are more effective at transferring complex, interdependent information and creating new knowledge (see Chapter 31). The density of connections among them would be high, creating a robust, cohesive unit."

They represent the power and unique dynamics that emerge when social relationships move beyond simple dyads into the complexity of three-person interactions."
