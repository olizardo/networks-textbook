    "text": "33.1 Why Triads are Special: Simmel’s Model\nSimmel’s model highlights crucial differences between two-person and three-person groups that contribute to the persistence of Simmelian ties:\n\n33.1.1 Individuality and Conformity\nIn a standalone dyad, individuals tend to maintain more individuality. There’s less external pressure on either person to compromise or conform to a third party’s views. In contrast, a dyad embedded in a triad (forming Simmelian ties) experiences greater pressure to conform to the views of others. Any individual member within a triad can be “outvoted” by the other two, which can lead to less individuality and autonomy. This external social pressure helps stabilize the relationships within the triad.\n\n\n33.1.2 Conflict Resolution\nStandalone dyads have a greater potential for unresolved differences. Conflict is often more difficult to settle because there is no neutral third party to mediate. If one person withdraws, the relationship dissolves, indicating a “power-symmetric” dynamic. In triads, there is more potential for conflict resolution. A dispute between two members can be mediated or arbitrated by the third member. Research supports that third parties are useful in alleviating dyadic conflicts. This inherent mechanism for conflict resolution makes the ties within a triad more resilient.\nConsider a friendship triad involving Alice, Bob, and Charlie. If Alice and Bob have a strong friendship (a Simmelian tie because it’s part of a closed triangle with Charlie), and they have a disagreement, Charlie can step in to mediate. This mediation by a third party helps resolve the conflict and preserve the tie between Alice and Bob, making it more likely to persist than if their friendship existed in isolation.\n\n\n33.1.3 Durability and Strength\nSimmelian Tie Theory predicts that Simmelian ties are stronger, last longer, and are harder to break than non-Simmelian ties. They exhibit greater durability and resistance to disruption. This is a direct consequence of the “top-down” effects triads have on the dyads that compose them, where all actors work together to keep ties from dissolving. This means they are less likely to decay or disappear over time. They also have a lower “liability of newness” which refers to the tendency of social ties to decay early on in the formation process.\nSimmelian ties are specifically described as symmetric, strong, and embedded. In this sense according to Simmelian Tie Theory, ties are strong because they are embedded in triads; strength is a result of embeddedness, not a cause of it as in Granovetter’s Strength of Weak Ties Theory (see Chapter 31)."

    "text": "33.2 Examples of Simmelian Ties\nSimmelian ties are not a distinct type of relationship in themselves (like “friend” or “coworker”) but rather describe the structural property and quality of ties when they are embedded within a strong, cohesive three-person group. Here are some examples:\nClose-knit friend groups.- A classic example arises when three friends (Person A, Person B, and Person C) are all strongly connected to each other. If Person A and Person B have a strong, reciprocal tie, and Person C also shares strong, reciprocal ties with both A and B, these interconnections form a closed triad. The ties between A-B, A-C, and B-C, being strong and mutually reinforcing within this small group, would be considered Simmelian. This aligns with Granovetter’s (1973) g-transitivity concept (see Chapter 31), where strong connections between two people imply they are likely to have other friends in common.\nFamily units.- Although kin ties can be symmetric (like siblings) or antisymmetric (like parent-child) based on role relations, if three family members form a highly interdependent and mutually supportive unit, the ties among them within that specific triadic structure would exhibit Simmelian qualities. For instance, two parents and a child who consistently provide emotional support, engage in frequent interactions, and mutually confide in one another would form a Simmelian triad, making their relational ties Simmelian.\nCore members of a small, collaborative team.- In a professional setting, if three individuals (e.g., co-founders, key project leaders) form a highly collaborative group with deep mutual trust, frequent interaction, and shared interests (homophily), their ties can become Simmelian. These “high bandwidth ties” (Aral and Van Alstyne 2011) are more effective at transferring complex, interdependent information and creating new knowledge (see Chapter 31). The density of connections among them would be high, creating a robust, cohesive unit."

    "section": "38.1 Transitivity in Dominance Orders",
    "text": "38.1 Transitivity in Dominance Orders\nTransitivity refers to a property where a relationship passes through nodes. In the context of dominance or hierarchy, it means that if individual A dominates B, and B dominates C, then A also dominates C. This is analogous to the mathematical concept where if A > B and B > C, then it logically follows that A > C. In directed networks, if A is above B, then A is also considered above every actor that B is above.\n\n38.1.1 Perfectly Linear Hierarchies: The Chicken Pecking Order\nThe concept of a perfectly linear hierarchy, where transitivity is consistently observed, can be clearly illustrated by chickens. When placed in a new environment, chickens engage in scuffles until a clear “pecking order” is established. The winner of a fight asserts dominance over the loser, and this process continues until every chicken knows its place in the hierarchy relative to all others. This hierarchy is ritually reinforced: a higher-status chicken will peck the head of a lower-status one, and the lower-status chicken will assent by lowering its head. This chicken “pecking order” is a classic example of a perfectly transitive dominance order.\n\n\n38.1.2 Human Hierarchies: Deviations from Perfect Transitivity\nUnlike chickens, human hierarchies are typically not perfectly transitive and can vary significantly depending on the context. For example, a teacher might have final authority in a classroom, but outside that setting, those authority relations may not apply or be enforceable. Similarly, someone might show deference to the President of the United States, but this hierarchy can invert during an election as the President’s position depends on the will of the voters. In other cases, two people might be members of two different clubs, each holding a leadership position in one of them, meaning their authority or hierarchical position shifts depending on the specific decision or context. These examples highlight that while hierarchies exist, humans often tacitly recognize an ordering, but disagreements over the factors determining status can arise, and the hierarchies are more context-dependent.\n\n\n38.1.3 Types of Triads in Dominance Hierarchies\nIn dominance networks (like those characterizing chicken pecking orders), there are several possible types of triads, which are subgraphs of three nodes. For a linear dominance order to exist, it must be transitive and contain no cyclical triads.\nHere are the different types of triadic configurations observed in dominance orders:\n\nNull Triad: This configuration consists of three nodes with no direct dominance links between them. It represents a state where no competitive interactions or dominance relations have been established within that specific group of three individuals.\nSingle-edge Triad: In this triad, only one dominance link is present between two of the three nodes. For example, if A dominates B, but there are no other direct links between A, B, and C. This is a foundational configuration from which other, more complex, hierarchies can emerge through iterative social competition.\nDouble-dominant Triad: This triad emerges from a single dominant node that asserts dominance over two other distinct nodes, forming two separate outgoing dominance links from one node. For example, A dominates B, and A also dominates C. This configuration is associated with Winner Effects, where a winning actor gains advantages (like increased confidence or experience) from a previous encounter, making them more likely to win future contests and extend their dominance.\nDouble-loser Triad: This configuration occurs when two nodes direct their dominance towards a single third node, indicating that this third node is subordinate to both. For instance, A dominates C, and B dominates C. This triad is associated with Loser Effects, where the losing actor in an agonistic encounter experiences disadvantages (such as lowered confidence or injury), making them more prone to losing subsequent contests. In Graph (a) of the practice problems, a double-loser triad is depicted, where two nodes send dominance to the bottom node. This suggests that the bottom node lost the initial contest and subsequently lost to the second node due to the loser effect.\nPass-along Triad: This configuration involves a chain of dominance, where A dominates B, and B dominates C, but there is no direct link between A and C. While it shows a form of hierarchy, it lacks the direct transitivity that defines a “pure” dominance order where A would necessarily dominate C.\nTransitive Triad: This is a key configuration for linear hierarchies, where if A dominates B, and B dominates C, then A also dominates C. The existence of the A-C link makes the hierarchy perfectly transitive and contributes to its linearity. This is considered an “expected” triad in dominance networks that approach a pure linear order.\nCyclical Triad: In a cyclical triad, dominance relationships form a closed loop, such as A dominates B, B dominates C, and C dominates A. This type of triad represents a violation of transitivity and is not expected in a pure linear dominance order because it signifies an absence of a clear, unambiguous hierarchy. The presence of such cycles is problematic for establishing a clear linear order."

    "section": "38.2 Models of Hierarchy Formation",
    "text": "38.2 Models of Hierarchy Formation\nSocial network analysts study the emergence of status hierarchies and dominance orders using two primary theoretical models: the attribute-based model and the interaction-based model. These frameworks provide distinct yet complementary explanations for how individuals attain and maintain their positions within a social hierarchy. A hierarchy is defined as a social network structure characterized by an inequality in authority or deference between actors. Deference occurs when an individual yields to another’s opinion or preferences without reciprocation, even if their own preferences differ.\n\n38.2.1 The Attribute-Based Model of Hierarchy\nThe attribute-based model of hierarchy posits that an individual’s position in a social hierarchy is largely determined by their inherent qualities, abilities, or underlying qualities. This model aligns with intuitive notions that the “best” individuals rise to the top, with others ranked below them based on their relative attributes.\n\nCore Premise: According to this model, an individual’s underlying characteristics directly influence their hierarchical standing. For instance, someone might possess talent in academics, excel in sports, exhibit humor, or be a particularly good friend. These qualities, regardless of their specific nature, are considered “quality” in this context. The hierarchy then naturally orders individuals based on these perceived attributes, with the “biggest, fastest, strongest” typically ascending to the highest echelons.\nRole of Deference: Roger Gould’s (2002) model explains how deference plays a crucial role in this process. If a less talented individual desires to form a connection with a more talented one, they might “exchange” deference for the association. This act of yielding to the more talented person’s opinions or preferences, even when their own differ, becomes a social signal of the recipient’s quality and status. Consequently, the recipient gains greater influence over the terms of the relationship.\nInfluence on Tie Formation: The formation of social ties in this model is thus influenced by an actor’s inherent quality, and any inequalities in quality are often compensated for through deference. However, if the level of deference required within a relationship surpasses the acceptable lack of reciprocity, the relationship may not form at all.\n\nThis model suggests a relatively stable hierarchy reflecting underlying capabilities, this is similar to how natural or evolutionary processes might lead to dominance based on intrinsic traits."

    "section": "38.3 Interaction-Based Model of Hierarchy",
    "text": "38.3 Interaction-Based Model of Hierarchy\nThe interaction-based model of hierarchy formation proposes that social hierarchies emerge not solely from inherent individual attributes, but significantly from the sequence and outcomes of past status competitions or agonistic encounters. This model contrasts with an attribute-based model, which suggests that hierarchy is a direct reflection of an individual’s underlying qualities like size, age, or strength (Chase 1982). Instead, the interaction-based model emphasizes how local network processes, specifically the results of competitive interactions, influence an actor’s future position in the social structure.\nThere are three primary types of effects that drive the formation of hierarchy within this interaction-based model: Winner Effects, Loser Effects, and Bystander Effects.\n\n38.3.1 Winner Effects\nWinner effects are the advantages or benefits that an actor gains from winning an agonistic encounter. These benefits contribute to an individual’s improved future chances in subsequent contests and their overall social position. For example, in a sports match, winning can enhance an individual’s confidence, making them more likely to win in future competitions.\nThe experience of successfully navigating a conflict can also lead to learned improvements in performance. Additionally, winning has been associated with a surge in testosterone, which may have biological ties to increased aggression and confidence, further bolstering a winner’s propensity for future success. The emergence of “double-dominant triads” is associated with winner effects, whereby a victor in a current context is able to dominate another actor in a future one.\n\n\n38.3.2 Loser Effects\nConversely, loser effects are the disadvantages or penalties incurred by an actor who loses an agonistic encounter. These can include lowered confidence, injury, or other detriments that negatively impact their future prospects in competitive interactions. Just as winning can create a positive feedback loop, losing can create a negative one, making it harder for the losing individual to succeed in future contests. Loser effects can lead to the emergence of “double-loser triads”, whereby a loser in a current encounter becomes the victim of an attack at a future time.\n\n\n38.3.3 Bystander Effects\nBystander effects refer to the benefits and penalties that accrue to an actor who observes an agonistic encounter but does not directly participate in it. The bystander’s position is influenced relative to both the winner and the loser of the observed contest via observational learning. While a bystander is likely to defer (and thus accept being dominated) to the winner in a future contest, they simultaneously become stronger in comparison to the loser, being more likely to dominate them in the future. This means that a bystander gains from the loser’s loss but loses from the winner’s gains, reinforcing the previous results of agonistic encounters.\nFor instance, consider three chickens: a strong one, a moderately strong one, and a weak one. If the strongest chicken fights and defeats the moderately strong chicken, the moderately strong chicken might suffer injury or a loss of confidence. As a result, the weakest chicken, who merely observed the fight, might now be able to defeat the moderately strong chicken, a feat it could not have accomplished before. This illustrates how the final hierarchy is not merely a reflection of inherent abilities but is also shaped by the order in which contests occur. Bystander effects can lead to the emergence of either “double-dominant triads” or “double-loser triads” from an initial “single-edge” triad configuration.\nThe overall implication of these three effects is that the resulting hierarchy within a social structure is not a pure, perfectly linear ordering based solely on individual attributes. Instead, it is a dynamic structure influenced by the history and sequence of interactions, where intransitive triads can become transitive through these processes. This iterative and social competition guarantees transitivity and linearity in the dominance order over time. Gould’s model, which incorporates actor quality and the desire for reciprocity, also highlights how these factors influence the formation of network ties, contributing to inequalities in social influence and potentially shaping hierarchical structures. Gould’s model suggests that a relationship may not form if the required deference exceeds the tolerated lack of reciprocity. When hierarchies are unclear or ambiguous, it can lead to conflict and competition among individuals."

    "section": "32.1 Definition and Core Concept",
    "text": "32.1 Definition and Core Concept\nA structural hole refers to the absence of a link between two parts of a social structure. In graph theoretic terms, these are “two-paths that are not full triangles”. For instance, if A is connected to B and C but B and C are not connected to one another, A bridges a structural hole between B and C. Essentially, structural holes represent gaps in the flow of information or control within a network. These “non-ties” are significant in creating opportunities for exchange.\nAs we saw in Chapter 24, when an individual’s network is characterized by clustering (where contacts are connected to one another), the effective size of their network is lower than its observed size, indicating that ego is connected to redundant contacts. In SHT this is referred to as a network that is high in constraint.\nThe concept of network constraint is the inverse of having structural holes. And individual who has high constraint lives in a social world in which most or all of their contacts are also connected to one another. This also means that the individual is heavily influenced by the strong expectations of a single group, and has to rely on others for information access, rather than being an independent source.\nConversely, low constraint ego networks are those that contain many structural holes (contacts not connected to one another), which facilitate intermediation through other individuals (alters). Networks rich in structural holes, often described as open networks, offer increased opportunities to acquire diverse information and ideas, as well as greater mediation in social relationships.\nSHT fundamentally aims to explain how to configure one’s network to control information. Individuals who position themselves to “fill” these holes act as brokers. An example of a graph with a structural hole would show two separate clusters that are not connected except via the broker. This lack of connection is significant because it prevents the passage of information or content from one part of the network to the other, except as intermediated by the broker."

    "text": "32.2 Benefits of Structural Holes\nStructural holes provide two primary types of benefits to the individuals who bridge them:\n\nPassive Exposure Effect: Brokers gain access to diverse information from different parts of the network that would otherwise be inaccessible. Because the groups they connect are not directly linked to each other, the information flowing through the broker is likely to be novel and non-redundant. This contrasts with strong ties, which often provide redundant information because closely connected individuals tend to know the same people and share similar information. This strategic position allows them to synthesize diverse information from various sources to create novel combinations and generate better ideas.\nActive Control Effect: This benefit grants the broker power to decide whether certain individuals receive specific information, influence how others perceive various individuals, and potentially play people against one another. In the same way, individuals occupying positions that bridge structural holes are less constrained by the norms and expectations of a single group. They are freer to navigate the social structure, allowing them to adapt their roles or presentations to different audiences.\n\nEmpirical studies, often conducted within corporate settings, suggest tangible benefits for individuals with networks rich in structural holes (i.e., low constraint). These individuals tend to receive higher salaries, experience faster promotions, and obtain better performance evaluations. They also demonstrate an ability to generate better ideas by combining disparate elements from various sources to create novel combinations (Burt 2004).\nIn essence, Burt’s Structural Holes theory emphasizes that having diverse contacts who are not connected to each other (i.e., operating across structural holes) provides unique benefits in terms of information access, control, and ultimately, social capital."

    "section": "32.3 Types of Brokerage",
    "text": "32.3 Types of Brokerage\nBrokerage can occur both within and between groups. Analysts have identified distinct types of brokerage than can occur in social networks (Gould and Fernandez 1989):\n\nWithin-Group Brokers: These individuals operate within a single defined group.\n\nCoordinators: A coordinator connects two people within the same group who would otherwise not be connected. The coordinator themselves is also a member of this group. This type of brokerage helps facilitate connections and potentially new syntheses within an existing cluster.\nItinerant Brokers: Similar to coordinators, an itinerant broker connects two individuals within a group, but the broker themselves is not part of that specific group. This role suggests a more external, consultative function in facilitating internal group ties.\n\nBetween-Group Brokers: These individuals span across different, often disconnected, groups.\n\nGatekeepers: A gatekeeper grants access from someone outside their group to someone within their own group. They control the flow of information or resources into their group.\nRepresentatives: A representative connects people from their own group to individuals outside their group. They act as an outward-facing link for their group. Liaisons: A liaison connects three actors, all of whom belong to different groups. This is the most expansive form of between-group brokerage, involving connections across multiple distinct social spheres.\n\n\nThese types of brokerage can be measured by counting the number of triads of each type, normalizing by the possibility of such counts occurring by random matching, and requiring the sorting of nodes into groups.\n\n32.3.1 Forms of Brokering Process\nBeyond the structural roles, brokerage can also be understood as a process with different forms of action (Obstfeld, Borgatti, and Davis 2014). Structural holes represent opportunities for brokerage, but realizing these opportunities requires motivation and action. Three forms of brokering are identified:\n\nConduit Forms: This involves the straightforward transfer of information, ideas, or solutions. It’s about problem-solving through synthesis. Structural hole brokerage is a primary example of conduit brokerage. This can also occur within groups, leading to “within group syntheses,” even without a “hole” in the traditional sense.\nTertius Gaudens (“the third who benefits”): In this form, the broker exploits the relationship between two other parties (alters) by keeping them disconnected or actively encouraging conflict between them (“divide and conquer”). This grants the broker control over their interaction.\nTertius Lungens (“the third who joins”): This form describes a broker who actively connects or facilitates interactions between alters. This can involve closing off a structural hole by bringing previously disconnected individuals into direct contact, or by coordinating interactions among those who are already connected but not necessarily interacting efficiently."
