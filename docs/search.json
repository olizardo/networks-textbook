    "text": "2.2 The Two Faces of Social Network Analysis\nSocial network analysis has two broad aspects. One, generally referred to as network theory is about figuring out how networks work and what networks do to and for people. In essence, social network theories are general statements about how people behave in networks and how networks themselves “behave”“; that is where network relations come from, what they do, and what consequences they have for the people involved.\nFor instance, the idea of social capital that is, that the connections that you have to others can bring you certain types of benefits, is part of network theory. In fact, as we will see later, a good chunk of network theory (but not all!), such as the theory of structural holes, or the strength of weak ties theory, can be thought of as theories of social capital (Borgatti and Halgin 2011). Other types of network theory deal with how networks of sentiment relations (e.g. likes and dislikes) form, while other tell us about how things flow through networks.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: The two faces of social network analysis.\n\n\n\nAnother branch of social network analysis deals with how to measure various network properties. This branch of social network analysis, called network measurement links social network concepts to some type of mathematical or quantitative representation. Since this branch of network analysis deals with measurement, it is where mathematics and other forms of quantitative representation of networks (such as matrices) come in handy.\nIf math scares you, don’t worry. Our job is to walk you slowly through it. But you still may be asking: Why math though? The beauty of math, is that it allows us to take some fuzzy social science concepts, stated in natural language, such as the idea of “popularity” or “social position” or “strength of connection” and give it a precise representation. That way we can use networks to learn about what makes the social world go round or predict why some people, organizations, or even whole countries are successful and others are not (among other things).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Levels of analysis in social networks.\n\n\n\nThe two “faces” of SNA (network theory and network measurement) as well as some choice examples are depicted in Figure 2.3. Don’t get nervous if you do not know what the things at the bottom of the diagram (e.g., “density”), mean. We will explain them to you in the forthcoming lessons.\nWe can develop theories or measure network properties at multiple levels of analysis. Like other complex systems, social networks feature dynamics at multiple nested levels. We will deal with five such levels in what follows.\n\nAt the node level we may be interested in what properties nodes have by virtue of the connections they have within the network. Both the idea of an ego network and various measures of social position based on centrality are defined at this level.\nAt the dyad and triad levels, we may be interested in the properties that the edges or the links have by virtue of settling into certain configurations. Both the idea of tie strength and various theories dealing with triples of nodes such as Balance Theory (Davis 1963), Strength of Weak Ties Theory (Granovetter 1973), the theory of Structural Holes (Burt 1995), and Simmmelian Tie Theory (Krackhardt 1999) are defined this level.\nAt the level of motifs may be interested in the network substructures or the “lego building blocks” that make up the larger network. For instance, how many configurations of three, four, or five actors can we observe?\nAt the subgroup or community We may be interested in properties that subsets or clusters or nodes have by virtue of the set of connections they share. Here, theories and measures of group cohesion, and community structure in networks have been developed.\nFinally, we may be interested in measuring properties and theorizing the structure and dynamics of the whole network. This may includes quantities that are sums or averages of features computed at lower levels, or they may include properties applicable to the system as a whole (e.g., whether it would take a short or a long time to get something from one randomly selected person in the network to another). Ideas of whether human networks constitute Small Worlds (Milgram 1967) are defined at this level.\n\nIn Figure 2.4 we can see how the nested structure of social networks can be depicted. At all levels we can develop specific theories to understand what is happening at that slice or develop special measures designed to link the concepts of those theories to a precise quantitative representation."

    "text": "2.3 Networks, Graphs, and Matrices\n’Social network analysis is an influential, and now increasingly widespread, methodological approach for analyzing the social world. Traditionally, sociologists have studied relationships using a variety of observational strategies, both qualitative, such as ethnography and interviews, and quantitative, such as those based on the social survey. However, beginning in earnest in the 1950s, sociologists began to make concerted use of mathematical techniques from a branch of pure mathematics called graph theory and a branch of applied mathematics called matrix algebra to develop scientific models of social relationships and to come up with measures connecting key concepts from social theory, such as roles, prominence, and prestige, to tangible empirical evidence.\nSocial Network Analysis (SNA) is the use of graph-theoretic and matrix algebraic techniques to study social structure and social relationships, which exist in real world networks. While much of this activity has to do with the measurement of social network concepts, Social Network Theory is the branch of social networks that tells us what social networks are, what they do, how they make a difference (negative or positive) in the world, and where networks come from and how they change over time.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: The ‘three-step shuffle’ in Social Network Analysis\n\n\nA key skill you will gain by taking this class is to transition swiftly from these three ways of talking about networks, namely, networks as real world systems of social interactions, networks as represented mathematically as graphs, and networks represented quantitatively as matrices. This three-step transition is represented in Figure 2.5. Another skill you will gain by taking this class is how to apply social network theory to understand how real world networks work and change."

    "section": "1.1 What is a Network?",
    "text": "1.1 What is a Network?\nSo what is a network? Minimally, a network is composed of a set of units or entities. These are some times called nodes or vertices, however what makes these units into a network is the fact that at least some pairs of them are joined by a set of links or ties. These are also sometimes called edges. Usually these ties represent the interactions or connections of the unit in a system. For instance, on a social media website, the users are the nodes and their interactions (following, commenting, liking) are the links.\nAccordingly, a network is essentially a set of nodes some of which are linked together, usually because the units interact in some ways, and the come to be connected via some kind of relationship. In social networks, the nodes can be people and the connections can be any type of social tie (e.g., friendship, enmity, co-working), whether positive or negative, between them.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Point and line plot of a network.\n\n\n\n\nIn a point and line plot such as the one shown in Figure 1.1, networks are represented as pictures. These kinds of pictures are also sometimes called sociograms or network diagrams (the people who don’t like them call them “hairballs”). The convention in these kind of pictures of networks is that the nodes (e.g., people) are drawn as circles (or some other polygon such as a triangles or squares) and the connections, ties, or links between people are drawn as lines or sometimes, if some kind of direction is implied, as arrows.\nThis way of representing networks is occasionally called a “graph”, although we will see that the idea of a graph is a little more abstract than just a picture. So in this class we will make a strong differentiation between pictorial network representations, and the mathematical concept of graph. When referring to the former, we will use the term plot or network diagram, reserving the term graph for the abstract mathematical object."

    "section": "1.2 Types of Networks",
    "text": "1.2 Types of Networks\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Types of Networked Systems.\n\n\n\nGiven the very broad definition of networks given in preceding, it should start to dawn on you why people think that networks are everywhere. And, come to think of it, they kind of are! Any system of interacting parts or entities can be depicted and analyzed as a network. That is why the idea of a network cuts across the information (e.g., networks of words in a text), social (networks of students in a school), physical (networks of servers on the internet), biological (networks of neurons in the brain) sciences, and psychological (networks of symptoms of mental disorders). The diagram in Figure 1.2 gives you an idea of the different types of networked systems that exist in the world.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Network of Characters in Game of Thrones. Image created by Marcos Martins Marchetti via https://www.kaggle.com/code/mmmarchetti/game-of-thrones-network-analysis\n\n\nFor instance, some social networks do not even have to be made up of real people! In fictional worlds, such as the Game of Thrones HBO series created from the books written by George R. R. Martin, some characters meet and get to know one another, but others never meet (or more likely in this show, (spoiler!) die before they get to meet). So we can construct a social network made up of acquaintance relations between the characters (who ended up meeting whom) such as the one depicted in Figure 1.3. This is a social network because the links are composed of a psychological or emotional relation between people.\nIn this case the relation “knowing somebody” in the GoT world is an example of a symmetric tie between people. In Figure 1.3, the size of the name of each character is proportional to the centrality of the actor in the network. As we will see in Chapter 23, centrality is an index of how important a given actor is in a network. So, even if you’ve never watched the show, you’ll know that Tyrion, Daenerys, and Jon are pretty important people in this show!\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: The U.S. Airport Network. Image created by Jose M Salln via https://jmsallan.netlify.app/blog/plotting-us-airline-airport-networks/\n\n\nOther networks are composed of links between physical technological systems not people. Take, for instance, the various airports (large and small, international and regional) in the United States. Everyday, some number of flights departs from one airport and lands on another. This means that airports in the US are linked via directed (e.g., from/to) ties in a socio-Technical network.\nThis network is a socio-technical network because it involves both social and technological links built from the flights that go from airport to the next (see Figure 1.4). The network is social because it is composed of people traveling. The network is also technological because its links are made possible by a complex web of air-flight technology, including planes, radars, in-flight computer systems and so forth. As we will in Chapter 4, the directed links between airports are an example of an asymmetric tie; some airports fly a lot to other airports (e.g., Small Regional to LAX), but other airports (e.g., LAX) only schedule flights to other big airports).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Network of Connectivity Between Brain Regions. Image from https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/wiring-the-brain\n\n\nAll of us carry around a very complex and staggeringly large network, composed of millions of nodes and billions of connections. The network is called the brain (see Figure 1.5). The nodes are a special type of biological cell called a neuron. Neurons are special because they have these filaments called dendrites and this long body called an axon. The axon of one neuron links up to the dendrites of another one, generating a large-scale complex network that allows you to breathe, eat, drink, think, see, smell and read these pages.\nBut the brain is not the only network you carry around. In fact, YOU, your whole body can be thought of as a network, at least according to network biologists (Lehnertz, Bröhl, and Rings 2020). For instance as you can see in the figure below, we can think of the body as network with organs playing the role of nodes and physiological connections between organs playing the role of connections. It turns out that song about all the bones being connected to one another wasn’t that far off from reality.\n\n\n\nThe Human body as a network via https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.598694\n\n\nThe brain is a biological network, because the nodes are biological units (neurons) as are the connections. And the same goes for the varioius organs and physiological systems that compose your body. Other biological networks include ecosystems were the nodes are species and the links are various types of relations between, some antagonistic (predator/prey) and others mutualistic.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Network of Symptoms in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Image from https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0137621\n\n\nThe nodes in a network can also be composed of psychological entities like attitudes, feelings, norms, types of thoughts, or emotions. In these psychological networks two entities are connected if they tend to occur in the same people. For instance, people who are have social anxiety, also experience loneliness, which is linked to depression.\nFigure 1.6 shows a psychological network of symptoms, taken from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM for shoort) created by psychological scientists who study psychopathology. In these network, the symptoms that cluster together (shown as nodes of different color) come to define specific types of mental disorders, like “Social Phobia” or “Panic Disorders.”"

    "section": "1.3 What is A Social Network?",
    "text": "1.3 What is A Social Network?\nAs you can see from the tree chart shown in Figure 1.2, only a subset of networks in the world as social networks. The key difference between social networks and other networks is that social networks have to involve people (or groups of people) and their perceptions, thoughts, interactions, and behaviors. Sometimes interactions between people are mediated by technologies. For instance, people can connect to one another by texting on their phone or traveling by plane, in which case the differentiation between what is a technological and a social network becomes a matter of degree.\nIn this class we will deal with networks that are closer to the “purely social” end of the scale: Those involving people, their perceptions, interactions, sentiments, exchanges, memberships, and relations. The primary perspective that we will take is that of social network analysis as developed in the discipline of sociology since the 1970s.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Social Science Disciplines that Contribute to and Use Social Network Analysis.\n\n\n\nAs noted, the inter-disciplinary field in charge of studying social networks is called social network analysis (SNA), and is composed of insights from a variety of other social science disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, psychology, communication, and others (see Figure 2.1). SNA in its turn, is part of an even larger interdisciplinary field in charge of studying all types of networks called network science which includes work in physics, computer science, data science, biology, engineering, mathematics, and other fields. The relationship between these different scientific fields is depicted in Figure 2.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: The Network of Network Science."

This would be trying to measure the status of each node by using their indegree centrality. Recall, from ?sec-centrality, that this is given by computing the column sums of the adjacency matrix (summing down each column across rows). In matrix form:\n\\[\nC^{IN}_i = \\sum_j a_{ij}\n\\tag{26.1}\\]\nThe results of the indegree calculation for all the nodes in the graph shown in Figure 26.1—with corresponding adjacency matrix shown in Table 26.1—are shown in Table 26.2 (a). According to the table, nodes \\(F\\) and \\(I\\) are the highest status nodes in Figure 26.1 because they each receive five and four nominations respectively They are followed by nodes \\(\\{A, B, E, J\\}\\) who receive three nominations each. Node \\(C\\) is the lowest status, as no one thinks they are important.\nHowever, the problem with using the number of incoming nominations as a measure of status is that the indegree centrality only measures the number of ties that are incoming to each node, but it does not differentiate between who sends each tie. Every nomination counts as the same. But as we noted, the whole point of the idea of status is that you gain status when you receive ties from high-status others, and their status is established by their receiving ties from high status others, and so forth.\nThis brings up another problem with the indegree centrality, which is that it is a purely local measure, counting only paths of length one (direct connections). But it is possible that you get status not only from the people you are connected to, but the people they are connected to (paths of length two) and the people those people are connected to (paths of length three) and so forth. A good measure of status would incorporate information from indirect ties (see Chapter 9).\nSo indegree centrality won’t do as a measure of status in social networks, if we aim to capture the full idea behind the concept."

One possibility is that we check some measure of status that comes from outside the network (the fancy word for this is exogenous). This could be for instance, the position of each node in the organizational chart, with ten indicating a top position and zero indicating an entry-level position. We could record this information using a \\(1 \\times 12\\) row vector where the exogenous status of each node i is given by each entry \\(\\mathbf{b}_i\\). Such an exogenous status score vector is shown in Table 26.2.

To calculate the status of each node we add up the status of each of the nodes that point to it.\nHow do we do this? Recall from Chapter 15, that it is always possible to multiply a row vector times a square matrix as long as the row vector is of the same length as the matrix’s row and column dimensions. The result is always another row vector of the same length as the original.\nAccordingly, we can get each person’s weighted status score by taking the exogenous status scores vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) and multiplying by the network’s adjacency matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). In this case, \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is \\(1 \\times 12\\) and \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is \\(12 \\times 12\\). Because the number of rows of the matrix are the same as the lengtth (number of columns) of the vector, the multiplication is allowed (the terms are conformable) and the result will be a \\(1 \\times 12\\) row vector of status scores that we will call \\(\\mathbf{s}^{ex}\\):\n\\[\n  \\mathbf{s}^{ex} = \\mathbf{b}\\mathbf{A}\n\\tag{26.2}\\]\nWhen we do that, we end up with the status scores shown in Table 26.2 (c).\nAs we can see, the status order is a bit different once we take into account the exogenous status of the other people who nominate each node. Yes, node \\(F\\) is still the highest ranked node, and node \\(C\\) is the lowest ranked. However, node \\(I\\) is no longer the second highest status node, that honor now goes to node \\(E\\). The reason is that while \\(I\\) has a larger indegree than \\(E\\), node \\(I\\)’s in-neighbors, as shown in Figure Figure 26.1 and Table 26.1, \\(N_{in}(I) = \\{A, C, G, K\\}\\) are relatively low status (except for \\(K\\)). \\(E\\)’s in-neighbors, by way of contrast, \\(N_{in}(E) = \\{B, F, I\\}\\) are all high to mid-status.\nNote that for each node, we can reconstruct their status score simply by adding up the status scores of their in-neighbors in Table 26.1. So for instance, node \\(A\\) gets at status score of 17. Where does this number come from? Well if we go to Table 26.1, we can see that \\(A\\)’s in-neighbors are \\(\\{H, J, K\\}\\) (looking down the column corresponding to \\(A\\)), and we can see that the corresponding status scores of each of these nodes in Table 26.2 (b) are 4, 4, and 9 (respectively), which means that \\(4 + 4 + 9 = 17\\), the status score for node \\(A\\)!"

    "text": "26.3 Using Endogeneous Network Information\nIt turns out, that in many cases, we don’t have exogenous status information on each node in the network to rely on. In that case, we must rely on endogenous network information to determine the status of each of the other nodes.\nOne approach is just to use original indegree centrality scores shown in Table 26.2 (a) as the status of each other the nodes. We can then say that a node is high status if it is pointed to by other nodes who are also pointed to by many other nodes. Conversely, a node is low status if it is pointed to by other nodes that are not pointed to by many other nodes.\n\\[\n  s^{en} = C^{IN}\\mathbf{A}\n\\tag{26.3}\\]\nWhere \\(C^{IN}\\) is the \\(1 \\times 12\\) row vector of indegree centralities shown in Table 26.2 (a) and \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is the the network’s adjacency matrix shown in Table 26.1. The results are shown in Table 26.2 (d). As we can see, considering only endogenous network information gives us a completely different picture of the status order than using exogenous information. Now \\(E\\) is definitely the highest status node, and \\(F\\) which was the highest status node based on exogenous considerations drops to fourth place, behind \\(B\\) and \\(J\\).\nLooking at Figure 26.1, we can see why this happened. Take the set of \\(F\\)’s in-neighbors \\(\\{C, D, H, J, L\\}\\). It is easy to see from Table 26.2 (a), that most of these nodes also have low indegree centrality (except for \\(J\\)). So even though \\(F\\) has five nodes pointing toward them (\\(C^{IN}_F = 5\\)), all of them are not very high-status people. By comparison \\(E\\) only has three in-neighbors \\(\\{B, F, I\\}\\), and all three are towards the top in terms of in-degree centrality. \\(E\\) has higher status than \\(F\\) according to \\(s^{en}\\) because the people that choose \\(E\\) are also chosen by many others, which is exactly what we want in a status measure.\nWhile \\(s^{en}\\) seems like a good measure of status, it does have one big drawback. It still only counts direct connections. As we noted earlier, it is possible that you get status not just from the nodes that point directly toward you, but from the nodes that point to those other people even if they don’t point toward you (e.g., two step connections), and perhaps from the nodes that point to those two-step alters, and the ones that point to those three-steps away, and so forth. A good status measure should be able to take into account the status of your indirect connections in computing your own status score. How do we do this?"

    "text": "26.4 A Mathy Interlude\nBefore we get to that, we will explore some recreational math. dConsider any number \\(x\\), where \\(x < |1|\\) (remember that \\(|a|\\) means “the absolute value of \\(a\\)), and thus \\(-1 > x < 1\\) (this reads”\\(x\\) is between -1 and +1”). Thus, \\(x\\) can be 0.43, or -0.62, or whatever in that interval. Recall that when we take a number in this interval and we raise it to a power, we end up with a smaller number than we begin with. The bigger the power, the smaller the result. For instance, take \\(x = 0.75\\). For instance:\n\\[\n  x^2 = 0.75^2 = 0.562\n\\] \\[\n  x^5 = 0.75^5 = 0.237\n\\] \\[\n  x^{10} = 0.75^{10} = 0.056\n\\] Because mathematicians are strange people, they like to say things like, “since the result gets closer to zero the bigger the power, then that means that when I raise the number to an infinite power, then the result should approach zero.” In equation terms:\n\\[\nx^{\\infty} = 0.75^{\\infty} \\approx 0\n\\] Since raising a number between -1 and 1 to a big power gets you closer to zero the bigger the power, mathematicians then go on to wonder whether adding up the powers, gets to the point where the sum does not grow anymore. For instance, what is the end point of:\n\\[\n  1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 \\ldots + x^{\\infty}\n\\tag{26.4}\\]\nThe idea is that as we move to the right and add a number between -1 and 1 raised to a bigger and bigger power, we add a smaller and smaller number, such that as we approach infinity, we end up adding such an infinitesimally small number that it might as well be zero. For instance, table Table 26.3 shows the result of raising \\(x\\) to the powers between 2 and 20 for \\(x = 0.75\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Power \n    Result \n  \n \n\n  \n    2 \n    0.562 \n  \n  \n    3 \n    0.422 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    0.316 \n  \n  \n    5 \n    0.237 \n  \n  \n    6 \n    0.178 \n  \n  \n    7 \n    0.133 \n  \n  \n    8 \n    0.100 \n  \n  \n    9 \n    0.075 \n  \n  \n    10 \n    0.056 \n  \n  \n    11 \n    0.042 \n  \n  \n    12 \n    0.032 \n  \n  \n    13 \n    0.024 \n  \n  \n    14 \n    0.018 \n  \n  \n    15 \n    0.013 \n  \n  \n    16 \n    0.010 \n  \n  \n    17 \n    0.008 \n  \n  \n    18 \n    0.006 \n  \n  \n    19 \n    0.004 \n  \n  \n    20 \n    0.003 \n  \n\n\n\nTable 26.3:  Incresing powers of the number 0.75. \n\n\nNow let us sum \\(1 + 0.75\\) and add the result to the sum of all the numbers in the third column of Table 26.3, to get an approximation to the sum shown in Equation 26.4.

    "section": "26.5 Katz Status Index",
    "text": "26.5 Katz Status Index\nIn the mid-twentieth century, the great statistician Leo Katz set out to develop a measure of status in social networks that took into account indirect connections. He first observed that the new matrix that results from taking the original adjacency matrix and raising it to a power (using matrix multiplication) has a clear interpretation. For instance, as we saw in Section 16.3, if we raise the adjacency matrix \\(A\\) shown in Table 26.1 to the third power (\\(\\mathbf{A}^3\\)) the resulting matrix will contain, as cell entries \\(a^3_{ij}\\), all the directed paths of length \\(l = 3\\) that have row node \\(i\\) as the starting column node and node \\(j\\) as the destination node, the same goes for any number \\(\\mathbf{A}^k\\). This means that the column sums of this matrix—or the row sums of the transpose \\(A^T\\)—will contain the number of paths of length three that are directed from all other nodes to a given node.\nKatz saw this as a way to incorporate indirect connections to construct a measure of status using only endogenous information. The idea would be to say that your total status is the sum of number of other people who choose you (or think you are great, or a great source or advice or whatever). However, among the people that choose you the ones that are chosen by many others should count for more. Those are people who are two-steps away from you. But the same should apply to the people who choose those others (people three-steps away from you). Overall, you should get more status from people who choose the people who choose the people, who choose the people…who choose you and you should get more status from the more people who are most likely to be chosen by those others, across any number of steps.\nTo accomplish this, we need to construct a new matrix that incorporates all this information about people’s one step, two-step, three-step, connections to others, then sum columns of that matrix (or the rows of the transpose). The resulting vector (\\(s^{Katz}_i\\)) would contain the desired score for each node \\(i\\).\nOne way to proceed would be to create the matrix by calculating the following infinite sum:\n\\[\nI + A + A^2 + A^3 + A^4 + \\ldots A^{\\infty} =\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{1} \\sum_{k = 0}^{k = \\infty} A^k\n\\tag{26.6}\\]\nWith the understanding that \\(A^0 = I\\) (raising a matrix to the zero power returns the identity matrix), and \\(\\mathbf{1}\\) is a row vector full of ones \\(\\mathbf{1} = \\{1, 1, 1, ... 1\\}\\) of the same length as the number of rows in \\(A\\), which when multiplied by \\(\\sum A^k\\) would return the column sums of that matrix (see Section 16.6.3) which would be our vector of Katz centrality scores for each node.\nThere are a couple of problems with Equation 26.6. First this sum keeps getting bigger and bigger and it does not have a natural end point (keeps going forever). This is because it is counting the direct connections (\\(A\\)) as much as the very indirect connections, like \\(A^5\\), or the number of indirect links connecting you to others five steps away.\nWhat we want is a way to count the first-step links the most, and then discount the longer-step links, with the discount getting larger the longer the chain. So that three-steps links count for less than two-steps links but count for more than four step links to others and so forth.\nKatz’s great idea is to multiply the original adjacency matrix and its powers by a number \\(\\alpha\\) that was larger than zero, but less than one. This leads to:\n\\[\nI + \\alpha A + \\alpha^2 A^2 + \\alpha^3 A^3 + \\alpha^4 A^4 + \\ldots \\alpha^\\infty A^{\\infty} =\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{1} \\sum_{k = 0}^{k = \\infty} \\alpha^k A^k\n\\tag{26.7}\\]\nWith the understanding that \\(\\alpha^0 A^0 = 1 \\times I = I\\), the first term in the sequence is once again the identity matrix. Now the difference between Equation 26.6 and Equation 26.7, is that as we saw before (see Equation 26.5), while the sum in Equation 26.6 keeps getting bigger and bigger (the technical term is “diverges”), the one in Equation 26.7, will stop growing, because raising a number less than one and more than zero (like \\(\\alpha\\)) to a bigger and bigger power will result in a tinier and tinier number, until we get close to zero. The sum will converge rather than diverge.\nMoreover, Katz knew his math, and noted that there is a version of {Equation 26.5} that applies to matrices, and which can be calculated without adding up an infinity of numbers. This is:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{1} \\sum_{k = 0}^{k = \\infty} \\alpha^k A^k = \\mathbf{1} (I - \\alpha A)^{-1}\n\\tag{26.8}\\]\nWhere \\(I\\) refers to the identity matrix (see Section 16.7). What Katz (1953) proposed is that we can turn the infinite sum part of Equation 26.8 (\\(I + \\alpha A + \\alpha A^2 + \\alpha A^3 + \\alpha A^4 + \\ldots \\alpha A^{\\infty})\\) into just \\((I- \\alpha A)^{-1}\\) following the principle outlined earlier in Equation 26.5. Just like the endless sum of squares of a number \\(x\\) between \\(-1\\) and and \\(1\\) just turns into just \\((1-x)^{-1}\\), the endless sums of a matrix containing numbers between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\) as its entries \\(\\alpha A\\) turns into \\((I-\\alpha A)^{-1}\\), with \\(I\\) playing the role of \\(1\\) and raising \\(I-\\alpha A\\) to the power of \\(-1\\) playing the role of taking the reciprocal.1\nKatz showed that the new matrix, \\(A^* = (I-\\alpha A)^{-1}\\) contains all the information we need, as it condenses the sums of all the status that a persons gets from all their connections both direct and indirect, regardless of how indirect, and it weighs each person’s contribution to each other person’s status by the status of those people (which is calculated in the same way). The column sums of this matrix \\(\\mathbf{1}(I-\\alpha A)^{-1}\\)will give us the Katz status scores we need as the contain information on all the indirect paths that start with other nodes and end in the focal node. Math magic to the rescue!\nLet’s see how it works, step by step:\n\nFirst we create the \\(12 \\times 12\\) identity matrix \\(I_{12 \\times 12}\\), show in Table 26.4 (a). As noted, this matrix has twelve ones across the diagonals and zeroes everywhere else. Then we choose a value for alpha. There are obscure mathematical reasons for why this value cannot be too big (depending on \\(A\\)), but for this example \\(\\alpha = 0.45\\) will work.\nSecond, we multiply \\(\\alpha\\) times the original adjacency matrix (shown in Figure 26.1) to get \\(\\alpha A\\). This new matrix is shown in Table 26.4 (b). In the new \\(\\alpha A\\) matrix, for every cell in which there is one in \\(A\\), the value 0.45 now appears in \\(\\alpha A\\).\nThird, we subtract \\(I\\) from \\(\\alpha A\\) , to get \\(I-\\alpha A\\). This new matrix is shown in Table 26.4 (c). Note that what this does is to add ones to the diagonals of \\(\\alpha A\\) and change all the other non-zero entries from positive to negative.\nFourth, we find the matrix that equals the reciprocal of \\(I-\\alpha A\\) (also called the matrix inverse of \\(I-\\alpha A\\)) to get \\((I-\\alpha A)^{-1}\\). The matrix inverse is somewhat involved to calculate for larger matrices like \\(I-\\alpha A\\), so, for now, chalk the numbers in Table 26.4 (d) up to math magic. Essentially you are trying to find a new matrix \\(W\\) such that when you multiply it by \\((I-\\alpha A)\\) you get \\(I\\) as the result; that is a matrix \\(W\\) is the inverse of another matrix \\((I-\\alpha A)\\) if and only if \\(W(I-\\alpha A) = I\\). This is just like the the reciprocal of any number \\(x\\), namely, \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) always equals to one when multiplied by that number: \\(\\frac{1}{x} \\times x = \\frac{x}{x} = 1\\). This new matrix, called the Katz proximity matrix is shown in Table 26.4 (d).2 In this matrix, the larger the number in the cell, the more node \\(i\\) is connected to node \\(j\\) via indirect connections.\nFinally, we compute the column sums of the Katz proximity matrix to get the Katz status scores for each node. In equation form:\n\n\\[\ns^{katz}_i = \\mathbf{1} (I - \\alpha A)^{-1}\n\\tag{26.9}\\]\nThe resulting scores are shown in Table 26.2 (e) for each node of Figure 26.1.\nAs we can see, according to the Katz’s status score, node \\(E\\) is still the highest status node in the network. They are followed by nodes \\(B\\) and \\(J\\), closely agreeing with the endogenous status scores obtained using the in-degree (Table 26.2 (d)). This makes sense, since the Katz scores can be seen as a generalization of the endogenous degree measure, with the latter taken into account only the first step links, and Katz’s taking into account all the indirect links regardless of lengths (but counting the really long ones very little, and counting the first step ones the most). In this way, the Katz approach is the most comprehensive way to compute the status of nodes using only endogenous network information.\n\n\nTable 26.4: Example of estimating status in social networks

    "text": "26.6 Hubbell’s Tweak on Katz’s Score\nSo far, we have discussed two main ways to measure the status of node in a social network, both based on the similar principle that people gain status from being (directly or indirectly) connected to high-status others (and get less status from being directly or indirectly connected to low status others). There are two ways to get a sense of the status of others. On the exogenous approach, we use some kind of prior ranking or knowledge (see Table 26.2 (b)) on the endogenous approach, we use only information on network connectivity (in-degree or the Katz approach).\nWhat if there was a way to combine both approaches and get the best of both worlds? That is, we count all the paths coming into a node from other nodes—of any length— and we weigh each path so that paths that start with high status nodes (according to our exogenous scores) count for more than paths that have low status nodes as their starting point.\nThis is exactly what was proposed by Hubbell (1965). It revolves around a relatively small tweak on Katz’s approach. The trick is to take the Katz proximity matrix computed according to to Equation 26.9 and pre-multiply it not by a row vector full of ones, like with Equation 26.9, but by the external row vector of status scores \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) itself.\nIn equation form:\n\\[\ns^{hubbell} = \\mathbf{b}(I-\\alpha A)^{-1}\n\\tag{26.10}\\]\nThe resulting Hubbell status scores are shown in Table 26.2 (f) for each node in Figure 26.1. As we can see, incorporating both endogenous and exogenous status information changes the picture, provided by the Katz scores creating more separation between high and low status nodes.\nNow, node \\(E\\) is the indisputable highest status node in the network, followed, at a distant second and third place, by nodes \\(B\\) and \\(F\\). Combining both endogenous and exogenous sources of information does reveal a deeper status inequalities in social networks."

    "section": "27.1 Bipartite Graphs",
    "text": "27.1 Bipartite Graphs\nA bipartite graph is useful to represent a network where, rather than ties occurring between nodes of the same kind (e.g., people connected with other people), ties occur only between nodes of different kinds but never between nodes of the same kind. Typically, the two different types of nodes are located at different levels of analysis or aggregation. As such, bipartite graphs are perfect for capturing the sociological concept of affiliation or membership with larger groups or events (Breiger 1974). For instance, actors and the movies they make, scientists and the papers they write, or people and the groups they belong to.1\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27.1: A bipartite graph. Circles are people and triangles are the corporate boards they belong to\n\n\n\n\nFor example, people work at companies, so we might say that a worker is connected with the company, rather than any specific individual there. People also connect to sports teams, schools, religious communities, and other organizations which can have an influence in structuring their social world.\nIn the graph theoretic sense, a bipartite graph \\(G_B\\) is a graph featuring two sets of nodes \\(V_1\\) and \\(V_2\\) and one set of edges \\(E\\). Thus a bipartite graph, like a signed and a weighted graph, is a set of three sets:\n\\[\n    G_B = (E, V_1, V_2)\n\\tag{27.1}\\]\n\nrepresents a network diagram of a bipartite graph where circles connect to triangles (with the shapes standing as labels for the two set of nodes). In the Figure, \\(V_1 = \\{A, B, C, D, E\\}\\) and \\(V_2 = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}\\). The edge set \\(E\\) is \\(\\{A1, A2, B2, B3, C2, C4, D4, D3, E3, E5\\}\\).\n\nOne common example of two-mode networks that be represented using bipartite graphs in sociology are corporate interlock networks (Mizruchi 1983). If 1) represented such a network, we could think of the circles as members of the company’s board, and the triangles are the board from each company. Because the same executive can be a member of more than one company’s board, board member A is on the board of both companies 1 and 2, while board member B is on the board of companies 2 and 3.\nNote that edges in a bipartite graph are symmetrical and thus bipartite graphs are (generally) undirected. This makes sense, since the relationship affiliation or membership is indeed symmetrical by definition. If person A is a member of the board in company 2 then it is understood that company 2 has person A as a board member.\nIn the same way, note that there is no reason why the cardinality of two node sets in a bipartite graph have to be same (although they are in the example provided). In a real world corporate interlock network, for instance, there will generally be more people than companies, so \\(|V_1| > |V_2|\\)."

    "text": "27.2 Unipartite Projections of Bipartite Graphs\nWhile the information we can glean from looking at the original bipartite graph alone may be useful, you might realize that board members A and B both are on the boards of company 2! In fact, board member C is also on the board of company 2! We might thus conclude that board members A, B, and C all know each other from sitting in the same company board.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27.2: A unipartite graph. People are linked if they serve in the same company board\n\n\n\n\nIf this sort of information was important, we could convert the bipartite into a simple unipartite graph capturing connections between the same level of analysis. This is called a projection of the original bipartite graph. In the projected graph, two board members are joined by a symmetric tie if they both serve on the board of at least one company together.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27.3: Another unipartite graph. Boards are linked if they share members.\n\n\n\n\nThus, we could, as shown in Figure 27.2, create a graph that shows board members who know each other because they work at the same company. The resulting (simple, undirected) graph shows that board members A, B, and C all know each other as a result of serving in the board of company 2 together.\nLikewise, we can transform the bipartite graph into a simple unipartite graph that captures companies that share board members. Company 2 is thus connected to Companies 1 (because of person A), 3 (because of person B), and 4 (because of person 5). This is shown in Figure 27.3). In fact, the reason why these are called interlock networks, is because it is easy to see that, ultimately, by virtue of sharing members across boards, most big corporations in the U.S. (and other countries), end up forming part of a single giant network."

The bipartite graph represents the two sets of nodes using different shapes or colors (blue and red nodes in Figure 27.4), and draws a link between the people and the group if the person is affiliated with the group.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27.4: Bipartite graph of a two-mode network of students and clubs.\n\n\n\n\nHow can we translate the graph representation into a matrix?\nThe procedure is the same as that used to build the adjacency matrix of the symmetric graph. We build a rectangular matrix whose number of rows is the same as the number of people in the affiliation network, and whose number of rows is the same as the number of groups. The matrix is rectangular (as opposed to square) because in a two-mode network, there is no restriction that the size of the two vertex sets be the same (although if they happen to be the same then you end up with a square matrix; after all, a square is a special case of a rectangle!).\nIn graph theory terms, this is a matrix that we call A, for affiliation matrix of dimensions \\(R \\times C\\), where the number of rows \\(R = |V_1|\\) is the cardinality of the first vertex set in the bipartite graph (persons in Figure 27.4), and where the number of rows \\(C = |V_2|\\) is the cardinality of the second vertex set (clubs in Figure 27.4)). The cells of the affiliation matrix, \\(a_{ij} = 1\\) if person i belongs to club j (there’s an symmetric edge in the graph linking the person to the group), otherwise, \\(a_{ij} = 0\\).\nFollowing these instructions would yield the affiliation matrix shown in Table 27.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFashion\nNerdfighters\nMagic\nSuper Smash Brs.\nCheese\n\n\n\n\nGabriela\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n\nParker\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nBrandon\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n\nMarie\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n\nRahul\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\n\nMinjoo\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\n\n\nTable 27.1: Affiliation matrix of a bipartite graph.\n\n\nThe affiliation matrix has some interesting properties. For instance, just like the adjacency matrix, it can be used to compute node degree centrality for each set of nodes. But since we have two different sets of nodes, we end up with two different sets of centrality scores; one set of centrality scores for the people and another set for the groups (Faust 1997).\nLet us see how this works."

Other people, (like Minjoo), just have a single interest, and thus join only one club (the Cheese Club).

The Cheese and Fashion Clubs on the other hand, seem to be more niche pursuits, with only two members each."

    "text": "27.6 The Person and Group Overlap Matrices\nIf the transpose of the affiliation matrix contains the same information as the original why do we care about it? Well the reason is that we can use the multiplication property described in ?sec-trans to extract two new matrices that contain new (or at least not obvious, especially for large two-mode networks), information from the original affiliation matrix. The first is called the person overlap matrix (written \\(O^P\\)), this is defined for an original affiliation matrix, in which people are listed in the rows and groups, events, or project, listed in the columns using the following matrix equation:\n\\[\n    O^P = A^{ }_{R \\times C} \\times A^{'}_{C \\times R}\n\\tag{27.6}\\]\n\n27.6.1 The Person Overlap Matrix\nUsing the rules for matrix multiplication discussed Section 16.1, the person overlap matrix obtained using the affiliation matrix shown in Table 27.1 is shown in Table 27.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGabriela\nParker\nBrandon\nMarie\nRahul\nMinjoo\n\n\n\n\nGabriela\n4\n2\n3\n1\n2\n0\n\n\nParker\n2\n2\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nBrandon\n3\n1\n3\n1\n2\n0\n\n\nMarie\n1\n1\n1\n2\n0\n1\n\n\nRahul\n2\n0\n2\n0\n2\n0\n\n\nMinjoo\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n\nTable 27.5: Person Overlap Matrix.\n\n\nThe person overlap matrix transforms the initial rectangular affiliation matrix, which has people in the rows and groups in the columns, to a square matrix, which like the usual relationship matrices we have been dealing with, feature people in both the rows and the columns. Each entry in the person overlap matrix \\(o^P_{ij}\\) now gives us the number of groups in which person i and j mutually belong to (Breiger 1974). So we learn that Gabriela and Brandon have three memberships in common (I bet they see one another a lot!) but that Rahul and Parker have no memberships in common (so they are less likely to encounter one another).\nNote also that, in the person overlap matrix, (in contrast to the usual adjacency matrix), there are valid entries along the diagonal cells (\\(o^P_{ii}\\)). These cells now record the total number of memberships that the node corresponding to that row (or column) has. Which we ascertained by computing the node centralities in the original affiliation matrix using Equation 27.2). You can see that the vector of degree centralities shown in Table 27.2) is the same as the vector formed by the diagonal entries in ?tbl-comem).\n\n\n27.6.2 The Group Overlap Matrix\nIn the same way we can compute the person overlap matrix, it is possible to calculate another matrix, called the group overlap matrix (written \\(O^G\\)), this time by multiplying the transpose of the original affiliation matrix times the original We do that using the following equation:\n\\[\n    O^G = A^{'}_{C \\times R} \\times A^{ }_{R \\times C}\n\\tag{27.7}\\]\nRecall from Chapter 16 that matrix multiplication is not commutative (if \\(A\\) is a rectangular matrix, then \\(A \\times A^{'} \\neq A^{'} \\times A\\))), so Equation 27.7 gives you a different answer than Equation 27.6. The result is shown in Table 27.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFashion\nNerdfighters\nMagic\nSuper Smash Brs.\nCheese\n\n\n\n\nFashion\n2\n1\n2\n1\n0\n\n\nNerdfighters\n1\n3\n2\n3\n0\n\n\nMagic\n2\n2\n4\n2\n1\n\n\nSuper Smash Brs.\n1\n3\n2\n3\n0\n\n\nCheese\n0\n0\n1\n0\n2\n\n\n\nTable 27.6: Group Overlap Matrix.\n\n\nThe group overlap matrix (O), like the person overlap matrix, is also square. But this time it has groups in both the rows and columns. Each cell in the group overlap matrix \\(o^P_{ij}\\) records the number of people groups i and groups j have in common (Breiger 1974). Thus, we learn that the Super Smash Brothers group and the Nerdfighters groups share three members in common but that the Super Smash Brothers and the Cheese group have no members in common (pointing to a disaffinity between these activities).\nNote that both the person and group overlap matrices are symmetric. It is easy to see why this is; if I have three group overlaps with you, then you by definition also have three group overlaps with me; if group A has three members in common with group B, then group B has three members in common with group A. This means that if they were to be taken as representing a network, then the resulting graph would be undirected (but weighted because there can be more or less overlap between people and groups). We will see how to do that below."

In a two-mode network if a node belong to one of the vertex sets, let’s say \\(V_1\\), then all of their neighbors have to belong to the other vertex set (\\(V_2\\)) and vice versa.\nFor instance, in Figure 27.4), Gabriela’s node neighborhood is:\n\\[\n    Gab_{NN} = \\{Fashion, Nerdfighters, Magic, SuperSmashBros\\}\n\\]\nRahul’s node neiborhood is:\n\\[\n    Rah_{NN} = \\{Nerdfighters, SuperSmashBros\\}\n\\]\nThe intersection between their neighborhoods is:\n\\[\n    Gab_{NN} \\cap Rah_{NN} = \\{Nerdfighters, SuperSmashBros\\}\n\\]\nSo now we can see that the number “2” recorded in the cell that corresponds to Gabriela and Rahul in the person overlap matrix shown in Table 27.5) is the cardinality of the subset formed by the intersection of their two neighborhoods, which in this case contain two members (the Nerdfighters and Super Smash Brothers clubs). The same procedure can be used to figure out the overlap between the node neighborhoods of groups (which happen to be subsets of people in the larger two-mode network)."

As we noted earlier, this is called the one mode projection of the two-mode network. Each two-mode network thus has two one mode projection one for each node set.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27.6: One mode (groups) projection of the original bipartite graph.\n\n\n\n\nThe one mode projection for the person node set of the bipartite graph show in Figure 27.4) is shown in Figure 27.5), this is an undirected weighted graph with the edge weight between people being set to the number of comemberships between each dyad as recorded in the person overlap matrix shown in Table 27.5). In this respect, the number of comemberships can be seen as a proxy of the tie strength between two people, when we only have information on their affiliations. As the Figure shows, Brandon, Gabriela and Rahul form a tightly connected clique, given the number of memberships they share. Minjoo, who does not share many affiliations with anyone, stands toward the periphery of the person-to-person comembership network.\nThe corresponding one-mode projection for the group node set is shown in Figure 27.6). This weighted graph can be read the same way: The thickness of the ties between groups are proportion to the people they share as recorded in the group overlap matrix shown in Table 27.6), thus speaking to the similarity or strength of connectivity between groups.\nSo we see, as we noted before, that Super Smash Brothers and Nerdfighters are tightly connected, but that the Cheese Club is largely peripheral in the group-to-group network. This peripheral status mirrors the marginal status of Minjoo (one of the few members of the Cheese Club) in the person-to-person network.\nThe fact that peripheral people belong peripheral groups and central people belong to central groups encodes a fundamental principle in the analysis of two-mode networks (Breiger 1974) and that is the duality principle.\nThe duality principle in two-mode network analysis says that the position of people in a two-mode network is defined by the positions the groups they affiliate with occupy, and in the same way, the position of the groups in a two-mode network is defined by the positions of the people that belong to them (Bonacich 1991)."

The key difference between social networks and other networks is that social networks have to involve people (or groups of people) and their perceptions, thoughts, interactions, and behaviors.\nSometimes interactions between people are mediated by technologies. For instance, people can connect to one another by texting on their phone or traveling by plane, in which case the differentiation between what is a technological and a social network becomes a matter of degree.\nIn this class we will deal with networks that are closer to the “purely social” end of the scale: Those involving people, their perceptions, interactions, sentiments, exchanges, memberships, and relations. The primary perspective that we will take is that of social network analysis as developed in the discipline of sociology since the 1970s.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Social Science Disciplines that Contribute to and Use Social Network Analysis.\n\n\n\nAs noted, the inter-disciplinary field in charge of studying social networks is called social network analysis (SNA), and is composed of insights from a variety of other social science disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, psychology, communication, and others (see Figure 2.1). SNA in its turn, is part of an even larger interdisciplinary field in charge of studying all types of networks called network science which includes work in physics, computer science, data science, biology, engineering, mathematics, and other fields.

They are all around us: you and your parents, you and your siblings, your siblings and your parents, you and your classmates, your classmates to each other. Affiliation, communication, friendship, hatred: these are the content of social relationships. Two people either have a relationship of some kind, or they do not. Essentially, a relationship is a connection between at least two social actors. We will see that sometimes, when relations clump together into networks, two sets of relations can have different content, but still share the same form (e.g., arrangement, or pattern).\nThe technical social networks term for “relations clumping together into networks” is concatenation (Martin 2009). For instance, every time you introduce two previously unrelated acquaintances to one another, you concatenate two previous disconnected ties into a connected triple."

If you were asked who your friends are, you would tell me that some of your classmates are your friends, and the rest of your classmates are not your friends. If you were asked which of these people in your classroom are your classmates however, everyone would be your classmate, except for your professor or teaching assistants. You share a particular type of relationship with these other people, your classmates, even if you’ve never met them. The word “classmate” even implies a relationship type, one with a different social meaning than “friend.” When analyzing a social network, it is important to first understand what type of social relationship you are analyzing, as it relates directly to what type of conclusions or generalizations you can make about the social world."

If you want to map out all the social relationships in the world, well that’s impossible. Imagine how difficult it would be to map out all the people at your school who are friends with one another. That might be feasible if you have only 1,000 undergraduates, but at a school of 30,000, it would be a nightmare. That is in part why it is so important to bound the social context. The other is to exclude relationships that are not meaningful for your study. Bounding, or to draw boundaries, is to have a rule about what will or will not be included in the study (Laumann, Marsden, and Prensky 1989).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: “The Zachary karate club network study was one of the first data collection probjects in the history of SNA. The data are famous for showing how networks could be used to find groups based on the relations between actors.”\n\n\nFor example, if you are interested in who is friends with who in your social networks class, you have bound your study to look at only people who are in your social networks class. One of the most famous social network studies was performed by the anthropologist Wayne W. Zachary (see Figure 3.2) at a college karate club in the 1970s (Zachary 1977). Thus, the 34 members of the karate club and the outside teacher were the actors included in the study because they were the people who were involved in the day to day operations of the karate club at the time data were collected.\nWith a type of social relationship in some bounded context, you can begin to map the social world as a graph. In its most basic form, a graph is essentially a picture of the relationships between different types of social actors. This picture becomes incredibly powerful when we begin to use mathematical concepts to understand how actors relate to each other (mostly what this book is concerned with) or upon what social principles the network may have been formed.\nWhile this class will mostly use the terms node and edge when referring to graphs, these are not the only terms in use among those who use network analysis techniques. Additional names for nodes include, vertex or point. Relationships between two nodes are, in addition to being called edges, are referred to as ties or links.

    "text": "3.4 The Building Blocks of Graphs: Edges and Nodes\nThere is a mathematical definition of a graph which is slightly more technical. A graph is a set, usually represented by the capital letter G.\nFrom high school math, you may remember that the mathematical definition of a set is simply a collection of entities, some of which may be ordered and some of which may themselves be other sets (a set can have sets as its members). In the case of graphs, the entities inside the collection are a set of vertices (also called nodes) and a separate set of edges (also called links).\nA graph is thus a set containing two sets as its members: a set of nodes (usually represented by the capital letter V) and a set of edges (usually represented by the capital letter E).\nIn set theory notation:\n\\[    \n  G = \\{V, E\\}\n\\tag{3.1}\\]\nWhich says that the members of the set defined by the graph, which we call G, are two other sets, called E and V (who themselves have a series of members inside). The usual notation, like in Equation 3.1, is to enclose the members of a set in brackets \\(\\{\\}\\).\n\n3.4.1 Nodes\nThe set of nodes usually represents actors in the real world social network. Point and line diagrams (such as the ones shown in Figure 3.2) are used to represent graphs, these in their turn represent the real social network.\nIn these diagrams nodes (representing actors) are usually drawn as a circle, but they could be any shape or symbol. In social network analysis, actors are often either an individual or an organization, but, as we have seen, in wider applications of the network imagery in the physical and biological sciences (usually going under the banner of network science), nodes can represent anything that links up to other similar entities in a larger system. These include power generation stations and homes, servers and computers, animals in an ecosystem, towns, really anything of substance that we can define some kind of relation on, or from which some type of content can be said to be exchanged.\n\n\n3.4.2 Edges\nEdges represent the presence of a connection or a social tie between two nodes. As we will see this can be a permanent relationship (e.g., “brother of”) or a more fleeting interaction (e.g., a text message, being in the same place at the same time). We will define what social ties are, how many types exist, and what their properties are, in lecture. For now, we can say that in social network analysis, connections are relationships, or links between nodes, and edges in a graph are meant to represent these connections.\nIn graph theory, the set of edges is best thought of as a collection of pairs of nodes, where the two members of the pair are the nodes involved in the social tie. So if node A is linked to node B via some social tie (friendship, study group, coworkers), then AB is a member of the edge set of the relevant graph. In set theory notation, this is usually written as \\(AB \\in E\\) which is read as “the edge AB is a member of the set \\(E\\).” Edges can also be referred to by juxtaposing the two nodes that are connected by the edge. Thus, the edge AB can also be written as \\(V_A V_B\\).\nIn the case of power generation stations and homes, the edges can represent power lines. Meanwhile, servers and computers are connected by internet cables and wi-fi access, while towns are connected by roads. The existence of edges signal the potential for content to flow, whether that’s power, computer data, or people in cars. In the case of social networks, the content that flows between two nodes are such things as influence, advice, information, and support. But it may also be disease, bullying, or gossip."

    "text": "3.5 What is a Graph?\nFigure 3.3 (a) shows an example of a point and line network diagram of a graph with four nodes and two edges. Nodes A, B, C and D are circles representing actors A, B, C and D, whose real world social relationships we are interested in studying. The lines drawn between A and B and likewise between B and C represent the edges, indicating the presence of a social tie. Thus the edges, AB and BC appear in the network diagram. The lack of an edge between nodes B and C reflects the absence of a relationship between actors named B and C in the real world.\nSo if we were to write out the graph shown in Figure 3.3 (a) in terms of the sets that define the graph, we would say:\n\\[\n  G = \\{E, V\\}\n\\tag{3.2}\\]\n\\[  \nE = \\{AB, AC\\}\n\\tag{3.3}\\]\n\\[\nV = \\{A, B, C, D\\}\n\\tag{3.4}\\]\nThis says that the graph G shown in Figure 3.3 (a) is a set with two members, E and V, each of which is its own set. The edge set of G has two members, AB and AC. The node set of G has four members, A, B, C, and D. The number of members in a set is typically referred to as the cardinality of the set, written \\(|N|\\) where \\(N\\) is the name of the set.\nSo, in the Figure 3.3(a) case, the cardinality of the edge set is two \\(|E| = 2\\), and the cardinality of the vertex set is four \\(|V| = 4\\). These two basic graph properties are so important, that they can serve as a “signature” for the graph. Sometimes people will refer to a graph as \\(G(n, m)\\) where \\(n\\) is the cardinality of the vertex set (number of nodes) and \\(m\\) is the cardinality of the edge set (number of links). Thus, the graph in Figure 3.3 (a), can be referred to as a \\(G(4, 2)\\) graph. Note that Figure 3.3 (a) this is not the only possible \\(G(4, 2)\\) graph.

So in Figure 3.3(a), nodes A and B are adjacent, as are nodes A and C. Pairs of nodes that are not linked by an edge, like nodes B and C, are said be nonadjacent.\nThe nodes at the two ends of each existing edge are said to be the end vertices of that edge. Each edge has two end vertices. As we have been doing, edges are named by typing together the names of their two end vertices. So the edge that has nodes A and B as its endpoints is called AB.\nIf an edge “touches” a node (e.g., connects it to another node) we say that that edge is incident on that node. So in Figure 3.3(a), the edge AB is incident on both nodes A and B. The relation of incidence will be important in a later lesson when we discuss network metrics computed at the node level like degree centrality.\nIn a graph, nodes that are not connected to any other nodes are called isolates. This means that in Figure 3.3(a), node D is an isolate because it has zero edges incident upon it.\nIf a node is connected to \\(n-1\\) nodes in a graph—basically, every other node but themselves—it is called a star node or a dominant node.

As we can see, every pair of nodes that is connected in (a) is disconnected in (b) and vice versa.\nWhat’s the graph complement useful for?

We will see in a later lesson that there are types of graphs that relax this restriction.\nThe second requirement is that graph does not contain any edges that have the same node as its two end points. These kind of edges are called loops, and they are edges that connect a node to itself! Clearly this does not make sense for most sociological applications.\n\nWith some exceptions, noted in subsequent lessons, simple graphs can represent most social networks."

How do we do that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original graph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) A subgraph of the original graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Another subggraph of the original graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) An edge deleted subgraph of the original graph.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: A graph (a) and a subgraph (b).\n\n\nWell, good thing that a graph is actually a set of two sets. If you remember your high school set theory, you can always take a set and consider only a subset of the original members.\nSince graphs are sets, we can do the same thing. A subset of the original nodes (or edges) of a graph, is called a subgraph. So if \\(G =\\{E,V\\}\\) is the original graph, the subgraph \\(G' = \\{E',V'\\}\\) is a subset of \\(G\\), which is written \\(G \\subset G'\\), with the understanding that \\(E' \\subset E\\) and \\(V' \\subset V\\). In mathematics, “\\(\\subset\\)” is the symbol for subset. Thus, \\(A \\subset B\\) is read as “set A is a subset of set B.”\nFor instance, let us say we are interested in just analyzing actors A, B, C, D, and E in the graph shown in Figure 4.1 (a). They seem to be a close-knit group of people. In that case, as noted earlier, if we call the original graph \\(G\\) with vertex and edge sets \\(\\{E, V\\}\\)we can define a new subgraph \\(G'\\), whose node subset \\(V'\\) only includes the actors we are interested in studying, in this case \\(V' = \\{A, B, C, D, E\\}\\), where \\(V' \\subset V\\).\nThe subgraph \\(G'\\) is shown in Figure 4.1 (b). It looks exactly like we wanted, capturing the relations between an inter-connected subgroup of actors in the original graph. Note that the edge set of the subgraph \\(E'\\) only includes those edges that are incident to the other nodes in the subgraph (as defined in Chapter 3) and omits those in the original graph that are incident to nodes that are not in the subgraph, so \\(E' \\subset E\\). As we will see in a later lesson, well-connected subgroups of actors of an original graph are called a cohesive subset."

That subgraph is weird (composed of two standalone connected dyads) and probably not very useful, but it is a subgraph of the original graph anyways!\nJust like we can define subgraphs based on the node set of a graph, we can define subgraphs based on subsets of the original edge set. For instance, we could pick the edges \\(E' = \\{AB, AC, AJ\\}\\) and define a subgraph based on them, which will necessarily include node set \\(V' = \\{A, B, C, J\\}\\).\nWhen a subgraph is defined by selecting a subset of nodes to keep (the common case) it is called a vertex-induced subgraph of the original graph, like Figure 4.1 (b).

    "text": "4.3 Vertex and Edge-Deleted Subgraphs\nA common reason for defining subgraphs in social network analysis is when we wonder what a network would look like if were to get rid of an actor or a set of actors. Sometimes this is useful, when we want to get a sense of how important that set of actors is for holding the network together.\nSo it is possible to define a subgraph by deleting nodes. This is written \\(G' = G - \\{a, b, c\\}\\), where \\(\\{a, b, c\\}\\) is the set of nodes we are deleting. So this says “give me a subgraph \\(G'\\) that is equal to the original graph \\(G\\) minus nodes \\(\\{a, b, c\\}\\).” In our previous example, Figure 4.1 (b) is the subgraph that results when we delete nodes \\(\\{F, G, H, I, J\\}\\) from the graph in Figure 4.1 (a): \\(G' = G - \\{F, G, H, I, J\\}\\). This is called a vertex-deleted subgraph of the original graph.\nThe subgraph that results from removing all the nodes of the original graph (so that the cardinality of the node set is now zero) is called the null graph. The subgraph that results from removing all the nodes of the original graph except for one (so that the cardinality of the node set of the resulting subgraph is equal to one) is called the singleton graph, also called the trivial graph as we saw in Chapter 3 (one is indeed a lonely number in social networks).\nJust like we can create subgraphs by deleting nodes, we can also create subgraphs by removing edges. For instance Figure 4.1 (d) is the subgraph that results from removing edges \\(\\{AB, AE, AC, CI, CE, GJ\\}\\) from the graph shown in Figure 4.1 (a). This is written \\(G' = G - \\{AB, AE, AC, CI, CE, GJ\\}\\), which says “give me a new graph \\(G'\\) which is equal to the original graph \\(G\\) minus edges \\(\\{AB, AE, AC, CI, CE, GJ\\}\\). This is called the edge-deleted subgraph of the original graph.\nA subgraph created by removing only edges, but leave all the nodes of the original graph intact, like in Figure 4.1 (d), is also called a spanning subgraph of the original graph.\nThe subgraph that results from removing all the edges in a graph, such that the cardinality of the edge set turns to zero, is called the empty graph.\nAs we will see later, subgraphs (as well as vertex and edge deletion) are a useful concept for discussing levels at an “in-between” levels, above the node level but “below” the whole network level: subgroups. However, subgraphs are also useful for network concepts at the node level, because there is a special type of subgraph, called the ego graph that is defined by picking a central node and the nodes that are connected to it, along with the edges connecting the nodes surrounding ego."

    "text": "5.1 Symmetric Ties and Undirected Graphs\nAs noted in Chapter 3, Nodes and edges are indeed the building blocks of a graph. However, types of relationships that the edges represent can change both how we understand the network conceptually and also what mathematical techniques we can apply to the graph when we compute graph metrics (the subject of Chapter 6). The basic idea is that when we do network analysis, we want to map our understanding of the nature of the social relationships we are studying to the types of graphs we use to represent the network formed by the concatenation of those relationships (Martin 2009).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: A undirected graph\n\n\n\n\nLet us assume that Figure 5.1 represents a network of people who spend time together. One way of building this network would be to ask people on your dorm room floor who are the people that they spend some amount of time (e.g., more than an hour a week) hanging out with. By definition the relation “spending time together” lacks any inherent directionality. Mutuality (or reciprocity) is built in by construction. It would be nonsensical for a person (say A) to claim that they spend time with another person (say B) and for B to say that they do not spend time with A. In social network analysis these types of ties are called symmetric ties (Heider 1946). So if \\(AB\\) means that A spends time with B if we know \\(AB\\) is true, then we know that \\(BA\\) is also true.\nIn the same way, two people being in the same place at the same time (co-location), even if they do not one another, is an example of a symmetric tie. You also have the symmetric tie “being in the same class as” every other student that is also taking your Social Networks seminar this term. Note that, in this sense, all co-memberships create symmetric ties among all actors involved (we will revisit this topic when talking about affiliation networks in Chapter 27). For instance, if I am a member of your family, you are also my family member; if we are both members of the soccer club, we are considered teammates.\nSocial networks composed of symmetric ties are represented using undirected graphs like the one shown in Figure 5.1. When an undirected graph has no loops (edges connecting a node to itself), and there is only one edge connecting adjacent vertices to one another (the graph has no multiedges), it is called a simple undirected graph.\nNetworks composed of symmetric ties have some interesting properties. If we know that the relationship (R) linking two nodes A and B is symmetric, then only a single edge exists that links them, and it does not matter whether we call this edge AB or BA. The order does not matter. In this way, we can formally define as symmetric tie as one that lacks directionality; if a tie is symmetric, then if we know that A is related to B (the AB edge is part of the edge set of the graph), then we know by necessity that B is related to A.\nCan you think of other examples of symmetric ties? Is friendship, as culturally defined in the contemporary world, a symmetric tie?"

    "section": "5.2 Asymmetric Ties and Directed Graphs",
    "text": "5.2 Asymmetric Ties and Directed Graphs\nIn contrast to spending time together, being members of the same family, or being in the same place at the same time, some social ties allow for inherent directionality. Edges in these graphs are are called asymmetric ties (Heider 1946). That is, one member of the pair can claim to have a particular type of social relationship with the other, but it is possible (although not necessary) that the other person fails to have the same relationship with the first.\nHelping or social support relations, are like this. For instance, you can help someone with their homework, or given them personal advice, but this does not necessarily mean that that person will return the favor. They may, or they may not. The point is that, in contrast to symmetric tie, mutuality or reciprocity is not built in by definition, but must happen as an empirical event in the world. We need to ask the other person to find out (or check their email logs). Can you think of other examples of asymmetric social ties?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: A directed graph\n\n\n\n\nReciprocity is an important concept in social network analysis. Some have said it is perhaps the most important concept for understanding human society (Gouldner 1960), which may be a bit of an exaggeration. Only asymmetric ties may have the property of being non-reciprocal or having more or less reciprocity. If I think you are my friend, I very much hope that you also think you are my friend.\nThat said, sociologists have found that in many natural social settings this is not the case. Sometimes people think they are friends with others, but those other people disagree (Carley and Krackhardt 1996). For this reason, sociologists typically ask: if I do you a favor, would you do me a favor in the future? Additionally, sociologists often ask: if I treat you with respect, will you also treat me with respect? If I text you, will you text me back? If this is true, we have a level of reciprocity in our relationship.\nFor some ties, such advice or support, or friendship relations, reciprocity is all or none; it either exists or it does not. For instance, the friendship offer you extend to someone may be reciprocated (or not). In the same way, you can like someone and they may like you back (or not), like the notes you passed around in middle school. For other ties, such as communication ties (e.g., those defined by the amount of texting, or calling), reciprocity is a matter of degree, there may be more or less. For instance, you can text someone 10 times a day, but they may text you back only half of those instances. In all cases, reciprocity is at a maximum when the content of the relationship is equally exchanged between actors.\nCan you think of relationships in your life characterized by more or less reciprocity?\nJust like symmetric ties are represented using a particular type of graph (namely, an undirected graph), social networks composed of asymmetric ties are best represented by a type of graph called a directed graph (or digraphs for short). Figure 5.2 shows the point and line diagram picture of a digraph. What were simple lines for in the undirected graph shown in Figure 5.1 have been replaced with arrows indicating directionality.\nA node sends a relationship to the node that the arrow points to, which in turn receives the relationship. In a digraph, up to two directed arrows may link nodes going in both directions. When an undirected graph has no loops (edges connecting a node to itself), and there is only one edge connecting a sender node to a receiving node (the graph has no multiedges) like Figure 5.2, it is called a simple directed graph.\nIn a directed graph, for every edge, there is a source node and a destination node. So in the case of “A helps B” the source node is A and the destination node is B. In the case of “B helps A” the source node is B and the destination node is A. This means that in a directed graph, in contrast to a undirected one, the order in which you list the nodes when you name the edges matters. Thus, the edge AB is a different one from the edge BA. The first one may exist but the second one may not exist (edges in a directed graph are sometimes also called arcs).\nFor instance, if Figure 5.2 were an advice network (Cross, Borgatti, and Parker 2001), on the other hand, we could say that H seeks advice from D, but D does not seek advice from H. This may be because D is higher in the office hierarchy or is more experienced than H, in which case lack of reciprocity may be indicative of an authority relationship between the two nodes.\nOne must always be careful when examining a directed network to make sure one properly understands the direction of the underlying social relationships!\n\n5.2.1 Types of Nodes in Directed Graphs\nIn a directed graph, there will typically be three types of (non-isolate) nodes (Harary, Norman, and Cartwright 1965):\n\nFirst, there will be nodes that receive ties but don’t send them. These are called receivers (like node C in Figure 5.2). For receiver nodes \\(k_{in} > 0\\) and \\(k_{out} = 0\\).\nSecond, there will be nodes that receive ties and also send out ties. These are called carriers (like nodes A and B in Figure 5.2. For carrier nodes, \\(k_{in} > 0\\) and \\(k_{out} > 0\\).\nFinally, there will be nodes that send ties but don’t receive them. These are called transmitters (like nodes E and G in Figure 5.2). For transmitter nodes, \\(k_{in} = 0\\) and \\(k_{out} > 0\\)."

    "text": "6.1 Computing Metrics on Graphs\nAs graphs are really just representations of real world-networks, they can be as varied as different networks are from one another. Some social networks are small (composed of just a few people), while others are large. In some social networks there is not much connectivity, while other networks feature thousands if not millions of ties between people.\nWe can quantify a lot of these properties of real world networks by representing them as graphs and then computing graph metrics. This is fancy word for counting various numbers most of which are a function of the number of nodes and edges in a graph. In this lesson, we will review the most important graph metrics in social networks.\n\n6.1.1 Graph Order\nThe order of a graph (typically written as \\(n\\)), is the number of nodes in the graph. Technically speaking, keeping in mind that the graph is really a set of a set of nodes and edges, the order is the cardinality of node set \\(n = |V|\\). Cardinality is simply a technical term from set theory indicating how many elements there are in a set. Thus, the graph in Figure 5.1 has an order of 9, while Figure 5.2 has an order of 7.\n\n\n6.1.2 Graph Size\nLikewise, the size of a graph (typically written as \\(m\\)), is the number of edges in the graph, which is (like with nodes) the cardinality of the edge set \\(m = |E|\\). Thus, the size of the graph in Figure 5.1 is 16, while the size of the graph in Figure 5.2 it is 11.\nThis means that if you say the size of the graph in Figure 5.1 is 16, we will all understand that you are referring to the number of edges, as you would use the term order if you were talking about the number of nodes."

    "text": "6.2 The Graph Maximum Size\nIn some cases we may be interested to know how many edges there could be in a graph if everyone had a relationship with everyone else in the network. This is the maximum possible number of edges that could exist in a network of order \\(n\\).\nRecall that, as we discussed previously, the number of edges in a graph is called the graph size. Additionally, a graph in which all the edges that could exist are actually present is called the complete graph. The maximum size of a graph of order \\(n\\) is the number of edges that would exist in that graph is the graph was complete. A graph in which no edges exist (every node is an isolate), is called an empty graph.\nWhile this may seem like a complicated thing, it is actually given by a simple (and important) formula. For an undirected graph this is:\n\\[\n  Max(E)^{u}=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\n\\tag{6.1}\\]\nFor a directed graph, the same computation is even simpler. The maximum number of possible edges in this case is:\n\\[\n  Max(E)^d=n(n-1)\n\\tag{6.2}\\]"

    "text": "6.3 Graph Maximum Size Explainer\nWhere do these formulas for maximum graph size come from? Let’s consider the directed case first. A graph would be complete if every node was connected to every other node. It is easy to see that for each node, this would be every other node in the graph except themselves. So in a complete graph of order \\(n\\), the degree of each node has to be \\(n-1\\). So if we call the degree of the first node in the graph \\((n-1)_1\\), then the degree set (\\(\\mathbf{k}^c\\)) of a complete graph would be:\n\\[\n  \\mathbf{k}^{c} = [(n-1)_1, (n-1)_2, (n-1)_3 \\dots (n-1)_n]  \n\\tag{6.3}\\]\nIt is easy to see the that the sum of degrees (\\(\\sum k_i^c\\)) of the complete graph, will give us the maximum size for any graph of that order. So we can write that sum as:\n\\[\n  \\sum k_i^{c} = \\sum_i^{n} n-1\n\\tag{6.4}\\]\nEssentially we add up \\(n-1\\) to \\(n-1\\) to \\(n-1\\), etc. \\(n\\) times, once for each node in the graph. From basic arithmetic, we know that adding the same number \\(n\\) number of times is the same as multiplying that number by \\(n\\). So therefore, the maximum size of a complete graph of order \\(n\\) is \\(n \\times n-1 = n(n-1)\\), the formula written as Equation 6.2!\nIn the undirected case (Equation 6.1, the procedure is the same, except that now each edge shows up twice in the degree sum, but one of those is redundant. Therefore we divide the whole sum of degrees by 2 to eliminate double-counting, resulting in \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) as the formula for the maximum size of an undirected graph or order \\(n\\).\n\n6.3.1 Applying your knowledge\nYou can now look a genius. If somebody were to ask you:\nQ: In classroom with 10 kindergartners, how many total pairs of friends would exist if every kid was friends with every other kid?\nUsing your graph theory metrics knowledge, you can now pull out your phone calculator and compute:\n\\[\n  \\frac{10(10-1)}{2} =\n  \\frac{10(9)}{2} =\n  \\frac{90}{2} = 45\n\\]\nImpressing your audience immensely!"

    "section": "6.4 Graph Density",
    "text": "6.4 Graph Density\nIn a classic study, the British social anthropologist Elizabeth Bott, made a classic distinction between two types of network structure. According to Bott, some networks are tight-knit and others are loose-knit (Bott 1957). Tight-knit networks feature a lot of connections and actors can reach others via multiple pathways. Loose-knit networks are more sparsely connected and actors are only reachable to one another via a very restricted set of pathways.\nIt was soon realized that a very simple graph metric, called the network density could be a useful index of Bott’s ideas of tight versus loose-knit networks. Tight-knit networks are dense featuring a lot of inter-connections between actors, while loose-knit networks are less dense (Barnes 1969). How can we think of this in terms of graph theory concepts?\n\n6.4.1 Density in Undirected Graphs\nThe density \\(d(G)\\) of a graph is a measure of how many ties between actors exist compared to how many ties between actors are possible, given the graph size (number of nodes) and the graph order (number of links). As such, the density of an undirected graph is quite simply calculated as, the ratio between the observed number of edges \\(m\\) (the cardinality of the edge set), and the graph maximum size as defined using Equation 6.1.\n\\[\n  d(G)^u=\\frac{m}{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}=m \\times \\frac{2}{n(n-1)}=\\frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\n\\tag{6.5}\\]\nWhere \\(m\\) is the number of edges (graph size) and \\(n\\) is the number of nodes (graph order) in the network.\nFor the graph shown in Figure 5.1, of size \\(m = 16\\) and order \\(n=9\\), we can use Equation 6.5 to compute the graph density as follows:\n\\[\n  d(G)^u = \\frac{2m}{n(n-1)} =\n  \\frac{2 \\times 16}{9 \\times (9-1)}=\n  \\frac{32}{9 \\times 8} =\n  \\frac{32}{72} =\n  0.44\n\\]\nThe estimated density of the network, \\(d = 0.44\\) tell us that 44% of the total possible number of edges are actually observed. Another way to think about density, is as giving the probability that, if we were to choose two random nodes in the network, this random dyad will have probability \\(p = 0.44\\) of being connected (as opposed to null).\n\n\n6.4.2 Density in Directed Graphs\nTo compute the density of a directed graph, there is no need to multiply the numerator by two, as each edge does single duty. As such, the equation for computing the density of a directed graph is:\n\\[\n  d(G)^d=\\frac{m}{n(n-1)}\n\\tag{6.6}\\]\nWhich is even simpler than in the directed case!\n\n\n6.4.3 Why is density important?\nThe density of a network property is important to consider for two reasons. First, (which is the definition of density!) is that it can help us understand how connected the network is compared to how connected it might be. Second, when comparing two networks with the same number of nodes and the same type of relationships, it can tell us how the networks are different.\nFor example, let us imagine that there are two organizations, each with 10 people in them. The one organization has high density and the other has low density in terms of the interactions among the members. What might be some of the underlying social differences between the two organizations? While we would need more information, we could posit that the one issue might be that information does not transmit very efficiently across the low density organization because it has to go from member to member, rather than diffusing from one member rapidly to all the others. Another issue might be the “hit by a bus” problem, where if one or two members are taken out of the network, you can suffer breakdown because they are no longer there to coordinate the different parts that don’t talk to each other. Denser networks are less vulnerable to disruption due to remove of key nodes."

    "text": "7.1 Node Neighborhoods\nAs we have seen, each node in a graph or order \\(N\\), given by the set \\(V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, \\dots v_N\\}\\) may be adjacent to a certain set of other nodes. In graph theory, these are called the node’s neighbors.The neighborhood of a node in a graph is written as \\(\\mathcal{N}(v)\\), where \\(v\\) is the node’s name in the graph. For instance, if we are referring to the neighbors of node A in the graph shown as Figure 7.1 we would write \\(\\mathcal{N}(A)\\).\nThe neighborhood of each node is a proper subset of the larger set of nodes in the graph \\(V\\). This is written as \\(\\forall v: \\mathcal{N}(v) \\subset V\\), which translates from math to English as “for all nodes \\(v\\), the neighborhood of \\(v\\) is a subset of the larger node set \\(V\\).” In Figure 7.1 for instance, \\(\\mathcal{N}(A) = \\{B, C, D, F\\}\\), and \\(\\mathcal{N}(A) \\subset V\\).1\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Another simple graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.1 Node Neighborhood Intersection\nNote that the neighbor sets of two nodes can have members in common. For instance, in Figure 7.1 we have \\(\\mathcal{N}(A) = \\{B, C, D, F\\}\\) and we also have \\(\\mathcal{N}(D) = \\{A, B, F\\}\\). These two sets share common members!\nSometimes we may be interested in the total number of other people that two nodes share a connection with. Like when you wonder how many people you and your friend are both friends with (or a social media algorithm lets you know). This is called the intersection of the two node neighborhood sets.\nSo if A and D are both nodes in a graph, the intersection of their neighborhood sets gives us a list of the other nodes in the graph they are both connected to. Using set theory notation, this can be written as: \\(\\mathcal{N}(A) \\cap \\mathcal{N}(D) = \\{B, F\\}\\), which says that nodes A and D have B and F as common neighbors.2\nThe cardinality of the sets formed by the intersection of the neighborhoods of all the nodes in the graph gives us the number of common neighbors between each pair of nodes, which may be zero if two neighborhoods sets are disjoint. As we saw in Chapter 3, in set theory, the cardinality of a set is the number of members in that set. Thus, the cardinality of the set \\(\\{A, B, C, D\\}\\) is four. Two sets are disjoint if they have no members in common, which means that their intersection is the empty set. We will see in a later lesson that this quantity has applications for deriving important matrices from graphs and computing some key network metrics in the network.\nNote that two nodes can have common neighbors even if they are not directly connected in the network! So the number of common neighbors is defined for both connected and null dyads.\nFor instance, in Figure 7.1, the intersection of the neighborhoods of nodes D and E exists and it is given by \\(\\mathcal{N}(D) \\cap \\mathcal{N}(E) = \\{B, F\\}\\) even though nodes D and E are not linked (they are nonadjacent).\n\n\n7.1.2 Node Neighborhood Union\nSometimes we may be interested in the total number of other people that two nodes are connected to, regardless of whether both of them are connected to them. Think of this as adding the set of people that you know with the set of people one of your friends knows, counting the people that your friend knows but you don’t, and the people you know but your friend doesn’t. This is called the union of the two node neighborhood sets.\nSo if A and D are both nodes in a graph, the union of their neighborhood sets gives us a list of the total number of other nodes in the graph either one is connected to.\nUsing set theory notation, this can be written as:3\n\\[\n    \\mathcal{N}(A) \\cup \\mathcal{N}(D) = \\{B, C, F\\}\n\\tag{7.1}\\]\nWhich says that nodes A and D have B C, and F as neighbors, but not necessarily common neighbors.\nAs we will see later, the intersection and union of the neighborhood sets can be used as a basis to construct measures of (structural) similarity between nodes in a graph."

    "text": "7.2 Node Neighborhoods in Directed Graphs\nJust like in undirected (simple) graphs, each node in a directed graph has a node neighborhood. However, because now each node can be the source or destination for a asymmetric edges, this means that we have to differentiate the neighborhood of a node depending on whether the node is the sender or the recipient of a given link.\nSo, we say that a node j is an an in-neighbor of a node i if there is a directed link with j as the source and i as the destination node. For instance, in Figure 5.2, E is an in-neighbor of C, because there’s a asymmetric edge with E as the source and C as the destination.\nIn the same way, we say that a node i is an out-neighbor of a node j if there is a directed link with i as the source and j as the destination. For instance, in Figure 5.2, F is an in-neighbor of G, because there’s a asymmetric edge with G as the source and F as the destination\nFor each node, the full set of in-neighbors forms the in-neighborhood of that node. This is written \\(N^{in}(v)\\), where \\(v\\) is the label corresponding to the node. For instance, in Figure 5.2, the node set \\(N^{in}(D) = \\{B, E, G\\}\\) is the in-neighborhood of node D.\nIn the same way, the full set of in-neighbors defines the out-neighborhood of that node. This is written \\(N^{out}(v)\\), where \\(v\\) is the label corresponding to the node. For instance, in Figure 5.2, the node set \\(N^{out}(B) = \\{A, C, D\\}\\) is the out-neighborhood of node B.\nNote that typically, the set of in-neighbors and out-neighbors of a given node will not be exactly the same, and sometimes the two sets will be completely disjoint (they won’t share any members).\nNodes will only show up in both the in and out-neighborhood set when there are reciprocal or mutual ties between the nodes. For instance, in Figure 5.2, the out-neighborhood of node F is \\(\\{A\\}\\) and the in-neighborhood is \\(\\{A, G\\}\\). Here node A shows up in both the in and out-neighborhood sets because A has a reciprocal tie with F."

In this case, we count the number of edges that have a given node \\(i\\) as one of their endpoints. Recall, that an edge that has a given node as one of their endpoints is said to be incident upon that node. So in the graph shown in Figure 7.1, the set of edges that have node A as one of their endpoints is:\n\\[\nk_A = \\{AB, AC, AD, AF\\}\n\\]\nWhich means that:\n\\[\n|k_A| = 4\n\\] Either way, computing degree as the cardinality of the node’s neighbor set or as the number of edges incident upon the node, gives us the number of other people that a given node is connected to in the network. We will see in ?sec-centrality, that this is an important measure of node position called degree centrality (Freeman 1977).\nIn a graph, nodes that have a degree equal to one, and thus have just a single neighbor in the graph, are called endpoints of the graph. Thus, in Figure 7.1, node \\(C\\) is an endpoint."

In a social network, for instance, a node having a large outdegree could indicate a sociable person (a person that likes to connect with others), while having a large indegree can indicate a popular person (e.g., a person lots of other people want to be friends with). In a later lesson we will see how to use a directed graph’s asymmetric adjacency matrix to readily compute the outdegree and indegree in real social networks."

    "text": "9.5 The Sum of Degrees\nNote that if we know the degree set of an undirected graph, we can figure out how many total edges there are in the graph. The reason for this is that the degree of each node can be defined in terms of the total number of edges incident on the node (as we noted earlier). So that means that if we know each node’s degree, then we can also know how many total edges there are in the graph.\nThe first step we need to do is compute the sum of degrees of each node in the graph. This quantity is written \\(\\sum_i k_i\\). For the degree set of the graph shown in Figure 9.1, we can see that the sum of the degrees \\(\\sum_i k_i = 32\\) (go ahead use a calculator to add up all the numbers in Table 9.1).\nIf you go back to the graph shown in Figure 9.1 and count the number of lines, you can see that there are 16. So summing up the degrees of each node ended up totaling twice the number of edges shown in the graph: \\(16 \\times 2 = 32\\). The reason for this is that each edge is incident (touches) two nodes, so it makes sense that when you add up the degrees of each node you end up with twice the amount of lines shown in the visual representation of the graph.\nSo the relationship between the sum of the degrees and the number of edges in an undirected graph is one of simple doubling. In equation form, this is written:\n\\[\n  \\sum_i k_i = 2m\n\\tag{9.4}\\]\nWhere m is the cardinality of the graph’s edge set \\(|E|\\). Some people call this the first theorem of graph theory (Benjamin, Chartrand, and Zhang 2015, 20)!\nAnother way to think about why we end up with twice the number of edges, is that in an undirected graph \\(G\\), if node A is a member of the set of neighbors of node B, then node B is necessarily also a member of the set of neighbors of node A. Thus, when computing the degree of each node, the edge AB does double duty, counting for the computation of both node A and node B’s degree scores, when we sum the degrees the edge thus shows up twice. Note that in the directed case we don’t have that problem, in which case \\(\\sum_i k_i = m\\)."

    "text": "9.6 Graphical versus Non-Graphical Degree Sequences\nEquation 9.4 has an interesting consequence that may not be immediately obvious. Putting our high-school algebra thinking cap on, we can solve for \\(m\\) and this will give us:\n\\[\n  m = \\frac{\\sum_i k_i}{2}\n\\tag{9.5}\\]\nWhich tells us that the number of edges in a graph is the sum of the degrees of each node divided by two. However, this also tell us something else: For any undirected graph, the sum of the degrees of each node will always be an even number. That’s because we know that \\(m\\) is an integer (the number of edges in a graph can’t be a decimal), so that means that the numerator of the Equation 9.5, namely, the sum of degrees \\(\\sum_i k_i\\) is divisible by two, and any number that is divisible by two (like 10, 24, 48, 120, etc.) is an even number. Ergo, the sum of degrees in a graph, \\(\\sum_i k_i\\), is always an even number.\nThis last result, that the sum of degrees of a graph has to be even, has yet another not so obvious consequence. Consider the following two sums:\n\\[\n4 + 3 + 2  + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 16\n\\tag{9.6}\\]\n\\[\n4 + 3 + 3  + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 17\n\\tag{9.7}\\]\nThe numbers in Equation 9.6 add up to sixteen, which is an even number. So we know automatically, that \\(\\{4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1\\}\\) could be the degree sequence of a possible graph with seven nodes (\\(n = 7\\)) and \\(m = 16 \\div 2 = 8\\) edges. In fact, one such possible graph is shown in Figure 9.2.\nHowever, we also know that since the sum shown in Equation 9.7 is an odd number, it cannot be the sum of degrees of any possible graph whatsoever. No undirected graph with seven nodes can have the degree sequence \\(\\{4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1\\}\\).\nIn graph theory terms, we say that the degree sequence \\(\\{4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1\\}\\) is graphical (could be the degree sequence of a possible graph), while the degree sequence \\(\\{4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1\\}\\) is not graphical.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: An undirected graph with degree sequence k = {4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1}.\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s the difference between the graphical sequence \\(\\{4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1\\}\\) and the not graphical sequence \\(\\{4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1\\}\\)? Time to find out.\nIn a graph, let us call a node with a degree that is an even number an even node. Let’s call a node with a degree that is an odd number (you guessed it) an odd node. You will notice that in the graphical degree sequence, there are four odd nodes \\(\\{3, 3, 1, 1\\}\\) and three even nodes \\(\\{4, 2, 2\\}\\). The not graphical degree sequence has five odd nodes \\(\\{3, 3, 3, 1, 1\\}\\) and two even nodes \\(\\{4, 2\\}\\).\nSo the number of odd nodes in the graphical sequence is even (four) and the number of odd nodes in the not graphical sequence is odd (five). Is this a coincidence? Turns out not!\nIn every graphical degree sequence, the number of odd nodes has to be an even number. That is to say, if a sequence of numbers has an odd number of odd numbers, then it cannot be the degree sequence of any possible graph! We could have checked because any sequence of numbers that has an odd number of odd numbers will sum to an odd number and we already know that a sequence of numbers that sums to an odd number is not graphical.\nThe number of even nodes, on the other hand, as we saw before can be odd and the sequence is still graphical. That’s because any set of even numbers, odd or even, will sum to an even number. So what matters is the number of odd nodes, which has to be even for a degree sequence to describe possible graph (Buckley and Harary 1990, 3). Heady!\nKnowing the link between the sum of degrees and the number of edges, we can begin to calculate some other important graph metrics."

    "text": "9.7 The Average Degree\n\n9.7.1 Average Degree in Undirected Graphs\nOnce we know what sum of the degrees is, we can compute an important graph metric called the average degree. This gives us a sense of whether there are lots of well-connected nodes in the graph (in which case the average degree is high), or whether the typical node in the graph only has a small number of neighbors (in which case the average degree is low).\nTo get the average degree for a graph, written \\(\\bar{k}\\), all we need to do is compute the sum of degrees (like earlier) and divided it by the total number of nodes in the graph:\n\\[\n  \\bar{k} = \\frac{\\sum_i k_i}{n}\n\\tag{9.8}\\]\nIn an undirected graph G like the one shown in Figure 9.1, the graph average degree is given by twice the total number of symmetric ties (the cardinality of the edge set as defined earlier) divided by the total number of nodes (the cardinality of the node node set). Because of the identity identified in Equation 9.4, where \\(\\sum_i k_i = 2m\\), we can also write the formula for the average degree as follows by switching the numerator:\n\\[\n  \\bar{k} = \\frac{2m}{n}\n\\]\nFor Figure 9.1, the average degree of the graph is:\n\\[\n  \\bar{k} = \\frac{2m}{n} = \\frac{2 \\times 16}{9} = \\frac{32}{9} = 3.6\n\\tag{9.9}\\]\n\n\n9.7.2 Average Degree in Directed Graphs\nWe can use a variation of the same procedure to compute the average degree in directed graphs. Take the directed graph shown in Figure 5.2, which has seven nodes and 11 edges. In this case, there is no need to “double” the number of lines as in the case of an undirected graph.\nWe could compute either the average indegree or the average outdegree of each node and it would give us the same answer, because each link unless does single duty in determining either the outdegree or indegree of each node. Accordingly, the average degree in the directed case is:\n\\[\n  \\bar{k} = \\frac{m}{|V|} = \\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{ 11}{7}=1.6\n\\tag{9.10}\\]\nEven easier!\nAlthough straightforward, the graph average degree provides a powerful tool to analyze the social world. For example, if we have two school clubs of the same size and we ask students who they are friends with in the club, we might get very different average degrees. Let us assume that the average degree in the first network is two, while in the second network it is five.\nThis statistic informs us that people in the second network have more friends within the group than in the first network. If we are interested in why the first group failed and the second group kept meeting, we might understand that the underlying social relations of friendship, which might be theorized as contributing to the clubs survival, were weaker in the first group to begin with than they were in the second group. We are thus able to gain insight into the causes and/or underlying conditions that shape the social world.\n\n\n9.7.3 The Connection Between Density and Average Degree\nThere is an intimate mathematical relationship between the graph density and the graph average degree. Let’s see what it is.\nTake another look at Equation 6.5. It says that density is equal to:\n\\[\n  d(G)^u = \\frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\n\\tag{9.11}\\]\nWe can write the same equation as the product of two different fractions. Like this:\n\\[\n  d(G)^u = \\frac{2m}{n} \\times \\frac{1}{n-1}\n\\tag{9.12}\\]\nNow, take a look at the first (left-hand) fraction of this product. Does it look familiar? It should, because it is the formula for the average degree we wrote down in Equation 9.8!\nSo that means that if we know the average degree and we know the number of nodes in a graph, we also know the density of the graph without knowing anything about the number of edges. Mathematical magic.\nHow do we do that? Well, substituting the fraction \\(\\frac{2m}{n}\\) for its equivalent, the average degree \\(\\bar{k}\\), in Equation 9.12 we get:\n\\[\n  d(G)^u = \\bar{k} \\times \\frac{1}{n-1} =  \\frac{\\bar{k}}{n-1}\n\\tag{9.13}\\]\nSo this formula tells us that the density of a graph is equivalent to its average degree divided by the number of nodes minus one. Pretty simple!"

    "section": "9.8 Advanced Degree Metrics Topics",
    "text": "9.8 Advanced Degree Metrics Topics\n\n9.8.1 Degree Variance\nOnce we know the average degree of a graph, it is possible to compute more complex measures of the heterogeneity in connectivity across nodes (e.g., the extent to which there is a very big spread between well-connected and not so well-connected nodes in the graph) beyond the simpler measures of range such as the difference between \\(k_{max}\\) and \\(k_{min}\\).\nOne such measure was proposed by the sociologist and statistician Tom Snijders in a paper written in 1981 (Snijders 1981). It is called the degree variance of the graph. It is written \\(\\mathcal{v}(G)\\) and it is defined as the average squared deviation between the degree degree of each node and the average degree:\n\\[\n  \\mathcal{v}(G) = \\frac{\\sum_i (k_i - \\bar{k})^2}{n}\n\\tag{9.14}\\]\nThe equation says that to compute the degree variance, first we create a vector of the square of the difference between each node’s degree and the average degree of the graph \\((k_i - \\bar{k})^2\\), then we sum all the values in this vector (note that since we are squaring all these values will be a positive number), and divide the result by the total number of nodes \\(n\\).\nTo compute the degree variance of the graph shown in Figure 9.1 using Equation 9.14, we can thus go through the following steps.\n\nFirst we compute the vector of differences between each node’s degree \\(k_i\\) (shown in Table 9.1) and the average degree \\(\\bar{k}\\) (already computed in Equation 9.9). This yields the following vector:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI\n\n\n\n\n0.44\n-0.56\n0.44\n1.44\n-0.56\n0.44\n-0.56\n-0.56\n-0.56\n\n\n\nTable 9.3: Differences between the degree of each node and the average degree.\n\n\n\nThen we square each of these numbers \\((k_i - \\bar{k})^2\\), which results in the following vector of squared deviations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI\n\n\n\n\n0.2\n0.31\n0.2\n2.09\n0.31\n0.2\n0.31\n0.31\n0.31\n\n\n\nTable 9.4: Squred differences between the degree of each node and the average degree.\n\n\n\nThen we compute the sum of all these numbers \\(\\sum_i (k_i - \\bar{k})^2\\), which is 4.2.\nFinally, we divide this sum by the number of nodes in the graph, which gives us:\n\n\\[\n  \\mathcal{v}(G) = \\frac{4.2}{9} = 0.47\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: A 3-regular undirected graph of order 10\n\n\n\n\nThe degree variance is supposed to capture the extent to which there is inequality in the connectivity of nodes in a graph. Inequality exists when a few nodes have a lot of connections and most nodes only have a few. The more inequality, the higher the degree variance. This means that in graphs where there is very little variation in the connectivity of each node (all nodes have roughly the same number of connections), the degree variance should be at a minimum.\n\n\n9.8.2 Regular Graphs\nThe most extreme version of the low inequality case is shown in Figure 9.3. This graph has ten nodes, and every node has the same degree \\(k = 3\\), which means that the average degree is also the same number \\(\\bar{k} = 3\\). This is called a regular graph.\nBecause in a regular graph, every node has the same degree, we refer to regular by their node degree (\\(k\\)) and their order (\\(n\\)) as k-regular graphs of order n. So, the example shown in Figure 9.3, where every node has degree equal to three (\\(k = 3\\)) and there are ten nodes (\\(n = 10\\)) is a three-regular graph of order ten. Because \\(k - \\bar{k} = 3 - 3 = 0\\) for all nodes in the regular graph, The degree variance of a regular graph is always zero (because the numerator of Equation 9.14 will always be zero).\n\n\n9.8.3 Node Average Nearest Neighbor Degree\nJust in the same way we can compute the degree of each node, we may be interested in in the question of whether nodes in the network tend to connect to others of high degree, or whether the connections in the network occur at random, irrespective of degree. The first situation, where people tend to connect to other people of high degree is called preferential attachment in network science (Barabási and Albert 1999). It is also referred to as a popularity tournament structure in sociology (Waller 1937). If you went to a real live high school, you may know how this works.\nTo get a sense of whether a given node prefers to connect to others who also have a large number of connections, we can compute an index called the average nearest neighbor degree, which is conventionally written \\(\\bar{k}_{nn(i)}\\).\nThis is given by the following formula:\n\\[\n  \\bar{k}_{nn(i)} = \\frac{1}{k_i} \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N(i)}} k_j\n\\tag{9.15}\\]\nThe formula says that to compute the \\(k_{nn}\\) of node i we take sum of the degrees of each of their neighbors j (remember that \\(j \\in \\mathcal{N(i)}\\) means “as long as node j belongs to the set \\(N(i)\\)”), and then divide it by the degree of node i.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI\n\n\n\n\n3.8\n4.3\n3.8\n3.6\n4.3\n3.5\n3.3\n3.3\n3.3\n\n\n\nTable 9.5: Average nearest neighbor degree of nodes in an undirected graph\n\n\nAs an example, the \\(\\bar{k}_{nn(i)}\\) for each node in the undirected graph shown in Figure 9.1 are shown in Table 9.5. This is the vector of average nearest neighbor degrees for the graph \\(k_{nn}\\). The table tells us that, nodes B and and E seem to have the strongest tendencies to connect to others who are also popular, while G, H, and I display the weakest such tendencies.\nBut can do we know if a \\(\\bar{k}_{nn(i)} = 4.3\\) is a big number or a small number? Well, we can compare each node’s \\(\\bar{k}_{nn(i)}\\) to the average degree (\\(\\bar{k}\\)) as defined previously. If a node’s \\(\\bar{k}_{nn(i)}\\) is bigger than the average degree of the graph, then we can say that their neighbors are more likely to be popular than expected by chance. For instance, we know, from the calculation shown in Equation 9.9, that the average degree for this graph is 3.6, so a \\(\\bar{k}_{nn(i)} = 4.3\\) tells us that a node connects to others that are (on average) more popular than the average person.\n\n\n9.8.4 The Graph’s Average Nearest Neighbor Degree\nIf we take the average of the average nearest neighbor degree vector for each node shown in Table 9.5, this would give us the graph’s average nearest neighbor degree (\\(\\bar{k}_{nn}\\)). But what could this possibly mean? Well, this would tell us the typical number of friends that the typical friend of the typical node in the graph has! Essentially, the expected number of friends of friends of the average person.\nIn a mind-bending paper, the sociologist Scott Feld (1991) showed, that with very few exceptions (e.g., regular graphs), the average number of friends of the typical person (the graph’s average degree) is smaller than the average number of friends of friends of the typical person in the same social network (the graph’s average nearest neighbor degree). That is, your friends have more friends than you do. Don’t get depressed. This is just how social networks work.\nCheck it out for yourself! If we compute the graph’s average nearest neighbor degree from the numbers in the vector shown in Table 9.5, this would give us \\(\\bar{k}_{nn} = 3.7\\) which is larger than the same graph’s average degree we computed earlier (\\(\\bar{k} = 3.6\\)). Weird!"

    "section": "5.3 Anti-Symmetric Ties and Tree Graphs",
    "text": "5.3 Anti-Symmetric Ties and Tree Graphs\nThere is a particular type of directed relationship that has the property of only going in one direction. These are called anti-symmetric ties. Like asymmetric ties, anti-symmetric ties have a directionality (and thus source and destination nodes), but reciprocity is forbidden by definition. That means that if A is anti-symmetrically connected to B, then B cannot send the same type of tie back to A.\nA common example of anti-symmetric ties in political sociology are patron-client ties (Martin 2009). Patrons can have many clients, but it is impossible for client of a patron to also be a patron to the same person. Other types of anti-symmetric ties include authority relations such as hierarchical ties at work, or cross-generational relations like kinship ties in families.\nIn the first (authority relations) case, your boss is your boss, while you cannot be your boss’ boss. The same goes for armies and other command and control structures, giving orders to is an anti-symmetric relation. An officer who gives orders to another officer (and thus commands them) cannot by definition also receive orders from them. Thus, Figure 5.4 could be a network in which the anti-symmetric links are directed “gives orders to” (in an army or an office) relations, where the source node directs commands toward the destination node. So A is the top boss and commands B, C, and D. Node B, in their turn, gives orders to E, who is at the lowest level of the command and control structure, not commanding anybody in turn.\nIn the second (cross-generational) case, your parents are your parents (but you can only be a son or daughter to your parents), and your grandparents are their parents, and so forth. “Being the parent of” thus counts as an anti-symmetric relation as we define here; it only goes way (from parents to children) but it cannot come back from children towards parents. Teacher-student, coach-athlete, buyer-seller, parent-child are all examples of anti-symmetric relationships that can be depicted as tree graphs.\nYet another set of relations that can only be represented using anti-symmetric links are dominance relations. These include negative interactions like “bullying”—or “pecking” if we are talking about chickens Chase (1982). Obviously if somebody bullies somebody else then they cannot be bullied back at the same time (although it could happen that a person dominated by a bully can become dominated by the person they used to bully, as when George McFly stood up to Biff in Back to the Future, thus reversing the direction of the one-way anti-symmetric link going from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) so that it goes from \\(B\\) to \\(A\\)).1\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: An oriented directed graph drawn as a tree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: A tree graph with thirteen nodes.\n\n\n\n\nAs we will see in Chapter 9, when considering connections between people that involve intermediaries, there is a special pattern called a cycle. This involves a node sending a directed tie to another node, which sends a directed tie to a third node. What makes it a cycle is that third node then sends a directed tie to the first node we began with. Recall from ?sec-triads, that the three-person subgraph AAA(C) shown in ?fig-AAAC forms a cycle. For instance, in ?fig-oriented, the sequence of directed edges \\(ED, DG, GE\\) forms a cycle starting and ending in node \\(E\\). Can you spot any other cycles in ?fig-oriented?\nOne feature of a network composed of only anti-symmetric relations is that its corresponding graph can always be drawn from top to bottom, starting (at the top) with the node that only sends but does receive any ties and ending (at the bottom) with nodes that only receive, but do not send, ties. This is called a tree layout. For instance, Figure 5.3 shows the same graph as in ?fig-oriented, but laid out as a tree.\nFor instance, if Figure 5.3 was a network composed of dominance interactions between people like “bullying” or “beating in a fight,” then the tree layout of the oriented graph would reveal the relevant dominance hierarchy between people. So we would conclude that node \\(D\\) being a transmitter node as defined in Section 5.2.1, that is, a node that is not the receiver of any dominance interactions but only a sender of them, is the “strongest.” No one dominates \\(D\\).\nNote that if you are dominated by somebody else in a dominance hierarchy, while you may not be able to dominate the person who dominates you back (given the anti-symmetric constraint), you can always dominate somebody else. This dynamic creates chains of negative interactions, which is exactly how bullying networks work when observed by sociologists.\nThus, in Figure 5.3, while \\(C\\) gets dominated by \\(D\\), they in turn bully \\(F\\) and \\(E\\). This creates dominance chains—technically known as a directed paths as we will see in Chapter 10—going from \\(A\\) to \\(C\\) to \\(F\\) and \\(E\\). Also note that in a dominance hierarchy, transmitter nodes like \\(\\{A, B, C, G\\}\\) in Figure 5.3 are both bullies and bullied, while receiver nodes are in the worst possible position only receiving negative interactions. ## References {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n\nCarley, Kathleen M, and David Krackhardt. 1996. “Cognitive Inconsistencies and Non-Symmetric Friendship.” Social Networks 18 (1): 1–27.\n\n\nChase, Ivan D. 1982. “Behavioral Sequences During Dominance Hierarchy Formation in Chickens.” Science 216 (4544): 439–40.\n\n\nCross, Rob, Stephen P Borgatti, and Andrew Parker. 2001. “Beyond Answers: Dimensions of the Advice Network.” Social Networks 23 (3): 215–35.\n\n\nGouldner, Alvin W. 1960. “The Norm of Reciprocity: A Preliminary Statement.” American Sociological Review, 161–78.\n\n\nHarary, Frank, Robert Z Norman, and Dorwin Cartwright. 1965.
