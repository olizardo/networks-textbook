    "section": "16.1 Matrix Multiplication Rules",
    "text": "16.1 Matrix Multiplication Rules\nFirst, we will let out the basic rules of matrix multiplication:\n\nYou can always multiply two matrices as long as the number of columns of the first matrix equal the rows of the second matrix. To check whether this is the case, all you have to do is put the two matrices side by side and list their dimensions.\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A}_{3 \\times \\mathbf{5}} \\times \\mathbf{B}_{\\mathbf{5} \\times 6}\n\\] - The two little “fives” in bold are called the inner dimensions of the two matrices. The little “three” on the left and the little “six” on the right are called the outer dimensions. So another way of stating the first rule of matrix multiplication is that the product of two matrices is defined as long as their inner dimensions equal to one another when you line them up from left to right.\n\nWhen the number of columns of a matrix equal the number of rows of another matrix so that their inner dimensions match we say that the the two matrices are conformable. When this is not the case, we say the matrices are non-conformable.\nThus, another way of stating the first rule is that only the product of conformable matrices is defined. If the matrices are not conformable then their product is not defined (e.g., there is no answer to the question of what we get if we multiply them!).\nThis means that unlike numbers or the matrix dot product, where the order of the two things you are multiplying doesn’t matter (\\(4 \\times 3 = 3 \\times 4\\) or \\(\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\mathbf{A}\\)), in matrix multiplication it does matter. Alas, for any two matrices \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\),\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{B} \\neq \\mathbf{B} \\times \\mathbf{A}\n\\]\n\nWhen you multiply a matrix times another matrix, the resulting matrix will have number of rows equal to the number of rows of the first matrix and number of columns equal to the number of columns of the second matrix. Thus:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A}_{3 \\times \\mathbf{5}} \\times \\mathbf{B}_{\\mathbf{5} \\times 6} = \\mathbf{C}_{3 \\times 6}\n\\tag{16.1}\\]\n\nEquation 16.1 says that the product of a three by five matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) (three rows and five columns) times a five by six matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) (five rows and six columns) is a third matrix \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) with three rows and six columns. Another way of saying this last rule is that the product of two conformable matrices will have dimensions equal to their outer dimensions.\n\n\n16.1.1 Multiplying a Matrix Times its Transpose\n\nBy definition, as discussed in Section 16.1.1, the rows of a matrix are equal to the columns of its transpose, and vice versa. The product of a matrix times its transpose and the transpose times the original matrix is always defined, no matter what the dimensions of the original matrix are. Thus,\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{A}^T = defined!\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A}^T \\times \\mathbf{A} = defined!\n\\]\n\nWhen you multiply a matrix times its transpose, the resulting matrix will be a square matrix with number of rows and columns equal to the number of rows of the original matrix. For instance, say matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}_{5 \\times 3}\\) is of dimensions \\(5 \\times 3\\) (like the matrix shown in Table 16.1 (a)). Then its transpose \\(A^T_{3 \\times 5}\\) will be of dimensions \\(3 \\times 5\\) (like the matrix shown in Table 16.1 (b)). That means the product of the matrix times its transpose will be:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A}_{5 \\times 3} \\times \\mathbf{A}_{3 \\times 5}^T = \\mathbf{B}_{5 \\times 5}\n\\tag{16.2}\\]\n\nEquation 16.2 says that a five by three matrix multiplied by its transposed yields a square matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) of dimensions five by five (a square matrix with five rows and five columns). In the same way,\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A}_{3 \\times 5}^T \\times \\mathbf{A}_{5 \\times 3} = \\mathbf{B}_{3 \\times 3}\n\\tag{16.3}\\]\n\nEquation 16.3 says that the transpose of a five by three matrix multiplied by the original yields a product matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) of dimensions three by three (a square matrix with three rows and three columns).\n\n\n\n16.1.2 Matrix Powers\n\nYou can multiply a matrix times itself to get matrix powers but only if matrix is a square matrix (has the same number of rows and columns). Thus,\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A}^2 = \\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{A}\n\\] \\[\n\\mathbf{A}^3 = \\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{A}\n\\] \\[\n\\mathbf{A}^4 = \\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{A}\n\\] \\[\n\\mathbf{A}^n = \\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{A} \\ldots\n\\]\n\nFor all square matrices \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) of any dimension. Since matrices used to represent social networks, like the adjacency matrix are square matrices, that means that you can always find the powers of an adjacency matrix.\nWhen you multiply a square matrix times another square matrix of the same dimensions, the resulting matrix is of the same dimensions as the original two matrices. Thus,\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A}_{5 \\times 5} \\times \\mathbf{A}_{5 \\times 5} = \\mathbf{A}^2_{5 \\times 5}\n\\]\n\n\nTable 16.1: A matrix and its transpose\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original Matrix. \n\n  \n    3 \n    4 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    7 \n    9 \n    3 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    6 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    5 \n    3 \n    4 \n  \n  \n    2 \n    5 \n    4 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Transposed Matrix. \n\n  \n    3 \n    7 \n    4 \n    5 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    9 \n    6 \n    3 \n    5 \n  \n  \n    5 \n    3 \n    2 \n    4 \n    4"

    "section": "16.2 Matrix Multiplication Examples",
    "text": "16.2 Matrix Multiplication Examples\nNow let’s see some examples of how matrix multiplication works. Table 16.2 shows the result of multiplying the matrix shown in Table 16.1 (a) times its transpose, shown in Table 16.1 (b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    50 \n    72 \n    46 \n    47 \n    46 \n  \n  \n    72 \n    139 \n    88 \n    74 \n    71 \n  \n  \n    46 \n    88 \n    56 \n    46 \n    46 \n  \n  \n    47 \n    74 \n    46 \n    50 \n    41 \n  \n  \n    46 \n    71 \n    46 \n    41 \n    45 \n  \n\n\n\nTable 16.2:  Matrix resulting from multiplying a matrix times its transpose \n\n\nNow where the heck did these numbers come from? Don’t panic. We’ll break it down. First, let’s begin with the number \\(50\\) in cell corresponding to the first row and first column of Table 16.2. To find out where this number came from, let’s look at the first row of Table 16.1 (a), composed of the vector \\(\\{3, 4, 5\\}\\), and the first-column of Table 16.1 (b), composed of the same vector \\(\\{3, 4, 5\\}\\). Now, the number \\(50\\) comes from the fact that we multiply each of the corresponding entries of the two vectors, and then add them up, as follows:\n\\[\n(3 \\times 3) + (4 \\times 4) + (5 \\times 5) = 9 + 16 + 25 = 50\n\\]\nNeat! Now let’s see where the number \\(74\\) in the fourth row and second column of Table 16.2 came from. For that we look at the entries in the fourth row of Table 16.1 (a), composed of the vector \\(\\{5, 3, 4\\}\\) and the second column of Table 16.1 (b) composed of the vector \\(\\{7, 9, 3\\}\\). Like before, we take the first number of the first vector and multiply it by the first number of the second vector, the second number of the first vector and multiply it by the second number of the second vector, and the third number of the first vector and multiply it by the third number of the second vector and add up the results:\n\\[\n(5 \\times 7) + (3 \\times 9) + (4 \\times 3) = 35 + 27 + 12 = 74\n\\] And we keep on going like this to get each of the twenty five numbers in Table 16.2 (there are twenty five numbers because Table 16.2 has five rows and five columns and five times five equal twenty five). In general terms, the number in the \\(i^{th}\\) row and \\(j^{th}\\) column of Table 16.2 is equal to the sum of the products of the numbers in the \\(i^{th}\\) row of the Table 16.1 (a) and the \\(j^{th}\\) column of Table 16.1 (b).\nNote that the resulting product matrix shown in Table 16.2 is symmetric. The same numbers that appear in the upper-triangle also appear in the lower triangle, such that \\(b_{ij} = b_{ji}\\). So once you know the numbers in one of the triangles, you can fill up the numbers in the other one without having to do all the multiplying and adding up!\nNow, let’s multiply the matrix in Table 16.1 (b) times the matrix in Table 16.1 (a). As the rules of matrix multiplication show, this will result in a matrix of dimensions \\(3 \\times 3\\) because Table 16.1 (b) has three rows and Table 16.1 (a) has three columns. This is shown in Table 16.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    103 \n    124 \n    72 \n  \n  \n    124 \n    167 \n    91 \n  \n  \n    72 \n    91 \n    70 \n  \n\n\n\nTable 16.3:  Matrix resulting from multiplying a matrix times its transpose \n\n\nLike before, if we want to figure out where the number \\(72\\) in the third row and first column of Table 16.3 came from, we go to the first row of Table 16.1 (b) composed of the vector \\(\\{5, 3, 2, 4, 4\\}\\) and the first column of Table 16.1 (a), composed of the vector \\(\\{3, 7, 4, 5, 2\\}\\) match up each number in terms of order, multiplying them and add up the result:\n\\[\n(5 \\times 3) + (3 \\times 7) + (2 \\times 4) + (4 \\times 5) + (4 \\times 2) =\n\\]\n\\[\n15 + 21 + 8 + 20 + 8 = 72\n\\]\n\n\nTable 16.4: Powers of a matrix.\n\n\n\n\n(a) A matrix. \n\n  \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Matrix squared. \n\n  \n    1 \n    1 \n    2 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    1 \n    2 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    2 \n    1 \n    2 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    2 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Matrix cubed. \n\n  \n    2 \n    2 \n    3 \n    3 \n  \n  \n    3 \n    2 \n    4 \n    3 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    3 \n    5 \n    4 \n  \n  \n    3 \n    2 \n    4 \n    2 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrix powers work the same as regular matrix multiplication, except that we are working on just one matrix not two. So for instance, the number \\(2\\) in the first row and third column of Table 16.4 (b) comes from the numbers in the first row of Table 16.4 (a) (\\(\\{0, 1, 0, 1\\}\\)) and the numbers in the third column of Table 16.4 (a) (\\(\\{0, 1, 1, 1\\}\\)). We line them up, multiplying them, and add them:\n\\[\n(0 \\times 1) + (1 \\times 1) + (0 \\times 1) + (1 \\times 1) = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 2\n\\] Since we are working with a binary matrix, the product of each of the cell entries will be either a zero (when at least one of the entries is zero) or a one (when both entries are one).\nTo get the cubed entries in Table 16.4 (c), we just take Table 16.4 (b) as the first matrix and Table 16.4 (a) as the second matrix, and do matrix multiplication magic. Thus, to get the number \\(4\\) in the third row and fourth column of Table 16.4 (c), we take the numbers in the third row of Table 16.4 (b) \\(\\{2, 1, 2, 2\\}\\) and the numbers in the fourth column of Table 16.4 (a) \\(\\{1, 0, 1, 0\\}\\), line them up, multiply them, and add them:\n\\[\n(2 \\times 1) + (1 \\times 0) + (2 \\times 1) + (1 \\times 0) = 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 4\n\\]\nPretty easy!"

    "section": "16.3 Matrix Multiplication of Vectors",
    "text": "16.3 Matrix Multiplication of Vectors\nRecall from Section 8.1 that a vector is a sequence of numbers of a given length. So for instance, the vector \\(\\mathbf{a} = \\{2, 4, 7, 2, 4\\}\\) is a vector of length five.\nWell, and here comes the big reveal, it turns out that another way to think of a vector, is as a special case of matrix. That is, a matrix with one row, and as many columns as the length of the vector! This is a called a row vector. So the row vector \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) vector can be thought of as a matrix of dimensions \\(1 \\times 5\\) (one row and five columns) or \\(\\mathbf{a}_{1 \\times 5}\\).\nIn matrix form:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    2 \n    4 \n    7 \n    2 \n    4 \n  \n\n\n\nTable 16.5:  Matrix resulting from multiplying a matrix times its transpose \n\n\nSince vectors are matrices, we can perform the same type of matrix operations on them as we did with matrices. For instance, we can compute the transpose of a vector. In the case of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\), the transpose \\(\\mathbf{a}^T\\) is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    2 \n  \n  \n    4 \n  \n  \n    7 \n  \n  \n    2 \n  \n  \n    4 \n  \n\n\n\nTable 16.6:  Matrix resulting from multiplying a matrix times its transpose \n\n\nThe transpose of a row vector is called (you may have guessed) a column vector. The column vector in Table 16.6 is a matrix with five rows and one column.\nThis also means that the same rules of matrix multiplication apply. For instance, we can always multiply a row vector times a column vector, because it is the equivalent of multypling a matrix times its transpose, and we have already seen in Section 16.1.1, that this can always be done:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{a}_{1 \\times 5} \\times \\mathbf{a}^T_{5 \\times 1} = b_{1 \\times 1}\n\\tag{16.4}\\]\nEquation 16.5 says that the product of the \\(1 \\times 5\\) row vector \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) times a \\(5 \\times 1\\) column vector \\(\\mathbf{a}^T\\) is a \\(1 \\times 1\\) “matrix” otherwise known as a scalar (that is, a regular old number). We’ve already seen examples of this, because in regular matrix multiplication, each cell of the product matrix is a scalar obtained from multiplying the corresponding terms taken from a row of the first matrix (which is a row vector) times those of the column of the second matrix (which is a column vector).\nSo in this case this would be:\n\\[\n(2 \\times 2) + (4 \\times 4) + (7 \\times 7) + (2 \\times 2) + (4 \\times 4) =\n\\]\n\\[\n4 + 16 + 49 + 4 + 16 = 89\n\\]\n\nThe first rule of vector matrix multiplication is that you can always multiply a row vector times a column vector (even when their entries are not the same) as long as they are the same length (e.g., the number of columns of the row vector equal the number of rows of the column vector).\nThe second rule of vector matrix multiplication is that when you multiply a row vector times another a column vector the result is always scalar (a single number).\n\nNow notice that if we change the order, and multiply the transpose of a vector times the original? This should be allowed because it conforms to the rules that we have already discussed:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{a}^T_{5 \\times 1} \\times \\mathbf{a}_{1 \\times 5} = B_{5 \\times 5}\n\\tag{16.5}\\]\nThis matrix multiplication is defined because the inner dimensions of the two matrices (the column and row vectors) are the same (one). But note that, according to the rules of matrix multiplication, when you multiply the transpose of a vector times the original, the result is a square matrix, with dimensions \\(n \\times n\\) where \\(n\\) is the length of the original row vector (the number of columns). In our example if the original vector is \\(\\mathbf{a} = \\{2, 4, 7, 2, 4\\}\\), then \\(\\mathbf{a}^T \\times \\mathbf{a}\\) is equal to the matrix shown in Table 16.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    4 \n    8 \n    14 \n    4 \n    8 \n  \n  \n    8 \n    16 \n    28 \n    8 \n    16 \n  \n  \n    14 \n    28 \n    49 \n    14 \n    28 \n  \n  \n    4 \n    8 \n    14 \n    4 \n    8 \n  \n  \n    8 \n    16 \n    28 \n    8 \n    16 \n  \n\n\n\nTable 16.7:  Matrix resulting from multiplying a matrix times its transpose \n\n\n\nSo, the third and final rule of vector matrix multiplication is that when you multiply a column vector times a row vector of the same length, the result is a square matrix of row and column dimensions equal to the length of the original vectors."

A numerical example of this situation is shown in Table 16.10.\n\n\nTable 16.10: Column vector resulting from multiplying a square matrix times a column vector\n\n\n\n\n(a) 5 x 5 square matrix \n\n  \n    2 \n    11 \n    14 \n    5 \n    15 \n  \n  \n    14 \n    19 \n    20 \n    6 \n    6 \n  \n  \n    11 \n    19 \n    13 \n    12 \n    15 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    9 \n    14 \n    12 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    19 \n    14 \n    1 \n    16 \n    18 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) 5 x 1 column vector \n\n  \n    2 \n  \n  \n    4 \n  \n  \n    7 \n  \n  \n    2 \n  \n  \n    4 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) 5 X 1 product vector \n\n  \n    216 \n  \n  \n    280 \n  \n  \n    273 \n  \n  \n    160 \n  \n  \n    205"

    "text": "16.6 Multiplying Matrices Times the All Ones Vector\nIn matrix multiplication, there is a special row and column vector called the all ones vector. As you may have guessed this is a vector of all ones, of some length \\(n\\). For instance and all ones row vector of length five is \\(\\mathbf{1}_{1 \\times 5} = \\{1, 1, 1, 1, 1\\}\\) (the symbol for the all ones vector is a boldface “1”). We can also get the transpose of this all ones row vector to get the all ones column vector \\(\\mathbf{1}^T\\).\nWhy do we care about vectors full of ones? Well, it turns out that the all one row and column vectors have a neat property when we multiplied by matrices. We already know, from the rules of vector matrix multiplication reviewed earlier, that the product of a row vector times a square matrix is always a row vector of the same length as the original, and the product of a square matrix times a column vector is always a column vector of the same length as the original.\nLet’s say we a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) of dimensions \\(5 \\times 5\\), and we multiplied the all ones row vector of length five times this matrix, which would result in the row vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\). This would be given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{1}_{1 \\times 5} \\times \\mathbf{A}_{5 \\times 5} = b_{1 \\times 5}\n\\tag{16.9}\\]\nA numerical example of the situation depicted in Equation 16.9 is shown in Table 16.11.\n\n\nTable 16.11: Row vector resulting from multiplying the all ones row vector times a square binary matrix\n\n\n\n\n(a) 1 X 5 all ones row vector \n\n  \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) 5 X 5 square binary matrix \n\n  \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) 1 X 5 product row vector \n\n  \n    3 \n    5 \n    2 \n    3 \n    1 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you look at the resulting row vector in Table 16.11 (c), we can see that the result of multiplying the all ones row vector times a matrix is a vector that contains the column sums of the matrix entries! So the “2” in position 1 of Table 16.11 (c) comes from adding up the numbers in the first column of the matrix, the “1” in position 2 of Table 16.11 (c) comes from adding the numbers in the second column and so forth.\n\n\nTable 16.12: Row vector resulting from multiplying the all ones row vector times a square binary matrix\n\n\n\n\n(a) 5 X 5 square binary matrix \n\n  \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    0 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) 5 X 1 all ones column vector \n\n  \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) 5 X 1 product column vector \n\n  \n    2 \n  \n  \n    3 \n  \n  \n    4 \n  \n  \n    2 \n  \n  \n    3 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the same way, if we multiply the same matrix times the all ones column vector, we get the results shown in Table 16.12. We can see that the result of multiplying a matrix times the all ones column vector, is another column vector contains the row sums of the original matrix! So, the “2” in the first position of the column vector comes from adding the numbers in the first row of the matrix, the “3” comes from adding the numbers in the second row, and so forth."
