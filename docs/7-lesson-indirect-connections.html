<p>Yes, you have friends. But your friends also have friends (and those people also have friends…). This means that, sometimes, when representing concatenated social relationships in networks as graphs, we are not only interested in the direct connections between <strong>adjacent</strong> nodes. Instead, we are interested in <strong>indirect</strong> connections between nodes. That is, in some settings is important to note not just who you friends are, but also who the <em>friends of your friends</em> are, or even the <em>friends, of your friends, of your friends</em> (and so on).</p>
<p>These types of <strong>indirect relationships</strong> are behind the (now) popular idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation"><em>six degrees of separation</em></a>. This is the widely held belief that if we follow a sequence of people and social ties, at the fifth or sixth step we may end up connected to a prominent or famous person (like Kevin Bacon). This is also the same idea behind the <strong>small world phenomenon</strong> popularized by psychologist Stanley Milgram in the 1960s <span class="citation" data-cites="milgram67">(<a href="#ref-milgram67" role="doc-biblioref">Milgram 1967</a>)</span>, as when two strangers meet at airport and realize that they have an acquaintance in common (“such a small world!”). The idea is that while they were not previously connected in the network, they were <strong>indirectly</strong> connected via a common contact without realizing it.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Graph theory can help us understand these types of indirect relationships in social networks.To do that, we must define a couple of concepts, and that is the idea of a <strong>path</strong> and <strong>connectivity</strong> between two nodes.</p>
<section id="paths" class="level2" data-number="12.1">
<h2 data-number="12.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="paths"><span class="header-section-number">12.1</span> Paths</h2>
<p>Take for instance, the undirected graph shown in <a href="#fig-paths1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-paths1</span></a>. In the Figure, nodes <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are not adjacent (they are part of a null dyad). However, <em>A</em> can still <strong>reach</strong> <em>B</em> using a <strong>graph-theoretic path</strong>, written <span class="math inline">\(A-B\)</span>. For instance, if <em>A</em> wanted to pass along a message to <em>B</em> without it having to go through the same person twice, they could tell <em>D</em> (using the edge <span class="math inline">\(A \leftrightarrow D\)</span>), who could tell <em>E</em> (using the edge <span class="math inline">\(D \leftrightarrow E\)</span>) who could the tell <em>B</em> (using the <span class="math inline">\(E \leftrightarrow B\)</span> edge). As noted above, this sequence of edges, namely <span class="math inline">\(A \leftrightarrow D, D \leftrightarrow E, E \leftrightarrow B\)</span> defines a <strong>path</strong> between nodes <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>.</p>
<p>To define a path, we could also write the names of the edges separated by commas while omitting the arrows as in: <span class="math inline">\(A-B = \{AD, DE, EB\}\)</span>. In a path, the first node listed in the sequence is called the <strong>origin node</strong> and the last node listed is called the <strong>destination node</strong>. The nodes “in between” the origin and destination nodes in the path are called the <strong>inner nodes</strong>. Together, the origin and destination nodes are referred to as the <strong>end nodes</strong> of the path. So in the path <span class="math inline">\(A-B = \{AD, DE, EB\}\)</span>, node <em>A</em> is the origin node, node <em>B</em> is the destination node, nodes <em>D</em> and and <em>E</em> are the inner nodes, and both nodes <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are the end nodes.</p>
<p>So what is a path?</p>
<p>In a graph, a path between two nodes <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> is a <em>sequence</em> of nodes and edges, such that the sequence begins with node <em>A</em> and ends with node <em>B</em> and <em>only goes through each of the inner nodes in the path once</em>.</p>
<p>Note that every path is actually a <strong>subgraph</strong> of the original graph as defined in <a href="#sec-graph-subgraphs"><span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">sec-graph-subgraphs</span></a>! Except that the subgraph that defines a path will always contain a sequence of vertices and edges connected in a line.</p>
</section>
<section id="properties-of-paths" class="level2" data-number="12.2">
<h2 data-number="12.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="properties-of-paths"><span class="header-section-number">12.2</span> Properties of Paths</h2>
<p>In graph theory, paths between pairs of nodes have some unique properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, as mentioned in the definition, <em>paths do not repeat nodes</em>. This means that each of inner nodes in the path (e.g., the nodes that are not the origin and destination ones) only appears <em>exactly twice</em> when we list the edges that make up the path, like nodes <em>D</em> and <em>E</em> in the <em>AB</em> in the path listing <span class="math inline">\((AD, DE, EB)\)</span>. The origin and destination nodes, in contrast, appear exactly once.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>Second, while it might not seem immediately obvious, because paths do not repeat nodes, they also <em>do not repeat edges</em>. As we will see later, this property helps differentiate paths from other less restricted types of edge sequences we may define in a graph featuring two nodes at the ends of it.<br>
</li>
<li>Third, paths are characterized by their <em>length</em>. The length of a path (<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{l}_{ij}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is the origin node and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is the destination node) is given by the number of edges included in it. So the length of the path <span class="math inline">\((AD, DE, EB)\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{l}_{AB} = 3\)</span> because there are three edges in the path.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
<li>Finally, there may be <em>multiple paths</em> connecting the same pair of nodes. For instance, In <a href="#fig-paths1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-paths1</span></a> node <em>A</em> can also reach node <em>B</em> via the path <span class="math inline">\((AC, CE, EB)\)</span> which is distinct from the one shown in red the Figure, but which also counts as a proper graph theoretic path (intervening nodes only appear twice in the listing, and the end nodes only appear once).</li>
</ul>
<p>This leads us to the graph theory definition of <strong>connectivity</strong> for pairs of nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In a graph, two nodes <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are <strong>connected</strong> if there is <em>at least one path</em> (of any length), featuring node <em>A</em> as the origin node and node <em>B</em> as the destination node. Otherwise, the two nodes <em>A</em> and<em>B</em> are <strong>disconnected</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>When a node can indirectly connect to another node via a path, we say that that the origin node can <strong>reach</strong> the destination node, or that the destination node is <strong>reachable</strong> by the origin node.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that once we understand the graph theory notion of <strong>connectivity</strong>, it becomes clear that the concept of <strong>adjacency</strong> is a special (limiting) case of connectivity: Two nodes <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> are adjacent when there is a path of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{l_{ij}} = 1\)</span> between them!</p>
<p>In a simple graph with no isolates, like that shown in <a href="#fig-paths1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-paths1</span></a>, it is easy to see that all node pairs are connected via a path of some length.</p>
</section>
<section id="connected-and-disconnected-graphs" class="level2 page-columns page-full" data-number="12.3">
<h2 data-number="12.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="connected-and-disconnected-graphs"><span class="header-section-number">12.3</span> Connected and Disconnected Graphs</h2>
<p>Look at <a href="#fig-paths1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-paths1</span></a> again. Are there any <strong>disconnected</strong> pairs of nodes in the graph? The answer is no. If you pick any pair of nodes, they are either directly connected, or indirectly connected to one another via a path of some length. So how can we get two nodes to be disconnected in a simple undirected graph? The answer is that there has to be some kind of “gap” splitting the graph into two or more pieces, so that some set of nodes can no longer reach some of the other ones.</p>

<p>For instance, if you compare the undirected graphs <a href="#fig-connected1-1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected1-1</span></a> and <a href="#fig-connected1-2">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected1-2</span></a> you can appreciate the difference between a <strong>connected graph</strong> and a <strong>disconnected graph</strong>. The difference between <a href="#fig-connected1-1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected1-1</span></a> and <a href="#fig-connected1-2">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected1-2</span></a> is that the <a href="#fig-connected1-2">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected1-2</span></a> graph is a subgraph of the <a href="#fig-connected1-1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected1-1</span></a> graph, in which the <span class="math inline">\(DF\)</span> edge has been removed (an <strong>edge-deleted subgraph</strong> according to what we discussed in <a href="#sec-subgraphs"><span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">sec-subgraphs</span></a>): <span class="math inline">\(G(b) = G(a) - DF\)</span>. Removing this edge has resulted in <span class="math inline">\(G(b)\)</span> being disconnected. There is no way we can trace a path connecting any of the vertices in the <span class="math inline">\(\{F, G, H, I\}\)</span> subset with any of the vertices in the <span class="math inline">\(\{A, B, C, D, E\}\)</span> subset. This is different from <a href="#fig-connected1-1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected1-1</span></a> where we can trace a finite path between any two vertices, even if it is very long. Thus, we can come up with a formal definition of <strong>graph connectivity</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A graph is <strong>connected</strong> if there exists a (finite) path between each pair of nodes.</p></li>
<li><p>A graph is <strong>disconnected</strong> if there does not exist a path connecting every pair of nodes</p></li>

<p>It is possible to split a graph into multiple components not just two. For instance, take a look at <a href="#fig-connected2-1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected2-1</span></a>. If we were to generate a subgraph from <a href="#fig-connected2-1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected2-1</span></a> by deleting the red and purple edges, we would end up with the <a href="#fig-connected2-2">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected2-2</span></a>; this graph is disconnected, and it features <em>three</em> separate components (connected subgraphs). If were to delete just the red edges from <a href="#fig-connected2-1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected2-1</span></a> and keep the purple edge, we would end up with the graph shown in <a href="#fig-connected2-3">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected2-3</span></a>. Like the <a href="#fig-connected2-2">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected2-2</span></a>, <a href="#fig-connected2-3">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected2-3</span></a> is also disconnected, but it is split into <em>two</em> not three components.</p>
<p>Note that one of the connected components in <a href="#fig-connected2-3">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected2-3</span></a> is way larger than the other one. The bigger connected component of graph <a href="#fig-connected2-3">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected2-3</span></a> is of order ten, but the smaller component is only of order four. When a disconnected graph is split into multiple components, the component containing the largest number of nodes (the connected subgraph of the highest order) is called <strong>the giant component</strong>.</p>

<h2 data-number="12.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-bridges"><span class="header-section-number">12.5</span> Bridges</h2>
<p>We went from the connected graph shown in <a href="#fig-connected2-1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected2-1</span></a> to the disconnected graphs in <a href="#fig-connected2-2">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected2-2</span></a> and <a href="#fig-connected2-3">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected2-3</span></a> by removing or deleting particular edges (like the red and purple ones in <a href="#fig-connected2-1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected2-1</span></a>). These edges are clearly more important than the other blue ones, because they are responsible for keeping the whole graph together as a connected structure. Edges whose removal results in a graph going from being connected to disconnected are so important that they have a special name: <strong>bridges</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus, in a graph the bridges are (smallest in terms of cardinality) set of edges whose deletion results in the graph becoming disconnected. For instance, in <a href="#fig-connected1-1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected1-1</span></a> the <span class="math inline">\(DF\)</span> edge is a bridge. In <a href="#fig-connected2-1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected2-1</span></a>, on the other hand, any two of the threesome formed by the two red edges and the purple edge count as bridges. Deleting any two of these three edges disconnects the graph.</p>
<p>Note that in contrast to <a href="#fig-connected1-1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected1-1</span></a>, <a href="#fig-connected2-1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected2-1</span></a> doesn’t have any <em>one</em> edge that is <em>the</em> bridge (the cardinality of the set of bridges is one). Instead, it takes deleting at least two edges from the red and purple set to disconnect it. For instance, if we were to remove just the purple edge, <a href="#fig-connected2-1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected2-1</span></a> would still be connected, and it would look like <a href="#fig-connected3-1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected3-1</span></a>, which is a connected graph. The same goes for removing just one of the red edges. If were to do that, we would end up with the graph shown in <a href="#fig-connected3-2">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected3-2</span></a>, which is also a connected graph.</p>

<h2 data-number="12.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="shortest-paths"><span class="header-section-number">12.6</span> Shortest Paths</h2>
<p>Consider the multiple ways node <em>B</em> can reach node <em>C</em> via a path in <a href="#fig-paths1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-paths1</span></a>. One possibility is the path defined by the edge sequence <span class="math inline">\((BE, ED, DA, AC)\)</span>. Another possibility is the path defined by the sequence <span class="math inline">\((BE, ED, DC)\)</span>. Yet another possibility is the path given by the edge sequence <span class="math inline">\((BE, EC)\)</span>. What’s the difference between these paths? Well, for the first one, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{l}_{BC}^{(1)} = 4\)</span>, for the second one <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{l}_{BC}^{(2)} = 3\)</span> and for the last one <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{l}_{BC}^{(3)} = 2\)</span>. The three paths are of different length, even though all three are proper graph-theoretic paths (they do not repeat inner nodes) and even though all three feature the same actors as the end nodes.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Let’s say <em>B</em> was a spy who needed to send an urgent message to <em>C</em> even though they don’t know <em>C</em> directly. If <em>B</em> wanted the message to get to <em>C</em> in the fastest way, they would use the <strong>shortest path</strong> between them, which in this case is <span class="math inline">\((BE, EC)\)</span>. For any two nodes in the network, the shortest path is the <em>smallest</em> existing path (in terms of path length) that has those nodes as the end nodes.^[This means that for every pair of connected actors in the network, we can define a shortest path between them.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Sometimes, as with actors <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> in <a href="#fig-paths1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-paths1</span></a>), there will be <strong>multiple shortest paths</strong> between two pairs of nodes, because we end up with two or more paths that are “tied” in length (and thus all count as “shortest” paths). So for nodes <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> in <a href="#fig-paths1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-paths1</span></a>, the two shortest paths connecting them are of length 3: <span class="math inline">\((AC, CE, EB)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((AD, DE, EB)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Observe that, in <a href="#fig-paths1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-paths1</span></a> if <em>B</em> really wanted to reach <em>C</em> via the shortest path, they will always have to go through node <em>E</em>. When this is the case, we say that <em>E</em> <em>stands in the shortest path</em> between <em>B</em> and <em>C</em>. So <em>B</em> is highly dependent on <em>E</em> to reach <em>C</em>. This makes <em>E</em>’s position in the network particular important for <em>B</em>, because they play the role of <em>go-between</em> or <strong>broker</strong> between <em>B</em> and the other actors in the network.</p>
<p>Because of this connection to communication efficiency and inter-mediation, shortest paths figure prominently in various measures of node position, called <strong>centrality measures</strong> we will deal with in <a href="#sec-centrality"><span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">sec-centrality</span></a>. One such measure, called <strong>betweenness centrality</strong> is based on counting the <em>number of shortest paths</em> between every other pair of nodes that a given node stands on.</p>

<p>The length of the shortest path between two pair of non-adjacent vertices in the network can be thought of as the “degrees of separation” between them. This is also called the <strong>geodesic distance</strong> between two nodes. For instance, the shortest path between nodes <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> is of length three, so <em>A</em> is three degrees of separation away from <em>B</em>. As we saw in this example, there does not have to be only one shortest path between two nodes. Actors in the network can be connected via multiple distinct shortest paths as are <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> in <a href="#fig-paths1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-paths1</span></a>).</p>

<p>Consider the edge sequence <span class="math inline">\((AD, DE, EC, CA)\)</span> highlighted in red in <a href="#fig-cycle">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-cycle</span></a>). What’s so special about it? Well, it looks like a path, because the inner nodes are only listed twice and so all the edges are unique. However, both the origin and destination nodes are the same!</p>
<p>Something like this sometimes happens with gossip. You start a rumor about someone by telling somebody else, and then a third person tells you the rumor that you started as if it was news to you! In this case, the rumor has traveled in the network via what is called a <strong>cycle</strong>.</p>
<p>A cycle is path,<em>of length three or larger</em>, <em>featuring the same node in both the origin and destination slots</em>.</p>
<p>Some directed graphs, are distinctive because they don’t have any cycles. It doesn’t matter how hard you try, or how long you stare at them, there is no way you will find a directed path of minimum length three that begins and ends with the same node. Directed graphs completely lacking in cycles are called <strong>directed acyclic graphs</strong> (DAGs). Note that <strong>tree graphs</strong> made up of <strong>anti-symmetric</strong> links, such as the one shown in <a href="#fig-tree">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-tree</span></a> are DAGs.</p>

<h2 data-number="12.8" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="trails-and-walks"><span class="header-section-number">12.8</span> Trails and Walks</h2>
<p>Not every sequence of nodes and edges that begins with one node and ends in another counts as a proper graph-theoretic path between two nodes.</p>
<p>For instance, looking at <a href="#fig-paths1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-paths1</span></a>, we could imagine a sequence of edges that started with one node and ended in another one without repeating edges, but repeating nodes. For instance, the sequence <span class="math inline">\((CA, AD, DC, CE, ED)\)</span> has node <em>C</em> as the origin node and node <em>D</em> as the destination node, and all the edges in the sequence are unique. However, the origin node <em>C</em> and the destination node <em>D</em> also appear in the intervening chain, which means that they are listed three times. This fails the path test for this edge sequence. Sequences like this, featuring all unique edges but repeated nodes, are called <strong>trails</strong>.</p>
<p>In the same way, we could imagine some kind of message traveling across the edge sequence <span class="math inline">\((AD, DC, CE, ED, DC, EC, EB)\)</span>. This sequence has <em>A</em> as the origin node and has <em>B</em> as the destination node. However, the sequence goes through nodes <em>C</em>, <em>D</em>, and <em>E</em> twice; moreover, the edge DC appears twice, as does the edge EC. This means nodes C, D, and E appear four times in the listing which also fails the “is this a path?” test for this sequence.</p>
<p>Arbitrary sequences of nodes and edges that begin with one node and end in another node but that feature both repeated nodes and edges along the way are called <strong>walks</strong>.</p>
<p>Walks, trails, and paths, form a hierarchy of increasingly less restricted “travels” from one node to another via edges in a graph. Walks are the least restricted (they can include both repeated nodes and edges) and paths are the most restricted (they cannot include repeated nodes, which by implication also means they can’t include repeated links). Trails are in between. They are forbidden from repeating edges but can use multiple nodes more than once.</p>
<p>This means all paths are trails, and are trails are walks, but not all walks are trails, and not all trails are paths!</p>

<section id="keeping-walks-and-trails-apart" class="level2" data-number="12.9">
<h2 data-number="12.9" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="keeping-walks-and-trails-apart"><span class="header-section-number">12.9</span> Keeping Walks and Trails Apart</h2>
<p>One way to keep these distinctions straight is by thinking about different types of things that <strong>flow</strong> through a network and how they may use paths, trails, or walks <span class="citation" data-cites="borgatti05">(<a href="#ref-borgatti05" role="doc-biblioref">Borgatti 2005</a>)</span>. Take for instance a <em>virus</em>. A virus doesn’t decide where to go. It just gets transmitted from person to person every time pairs of people (or multiple pairs if it’s a mass gathering) come into contact with one another. The same person can become exposed to the virus multiple times via different links (so the chain repeats nodes). In the same way, the same link (your best friend) can expose you to the virus multiple times (so the chain repeats edges). This means that viruses form transmission chains in social networks that look like <strong>walks</strong>: they repeat both nodes and edges. In this way, viruses are very much like money. If you buy something with a dollar, and the person you gave the dollar to buys something with it, the dollar can come back to you after flowing through the network for a while, so money also travels through networks via walks because it can repeat both nodes and edges.</p>
<p>How about trails? We already mentioned the idea of “six degrees of separation.” In the 1960s, the social psychologist Stanley <span class="citation" data-cites="milgram67">Milgram (<a href="#ref-milgram67" role="doc-biblioref">1967</a>)</span> designed an experiment where he sent almost two hundred packages containing a letter to a bunch of random people in Nebraska. The letter had the name of a stockbroker who lived in Boston and instructions that read: “If you know this person and where they live, send them this package; if you don’t know this person, forward it to someone you know who you think might know this person.” This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_experiment"><strong>small world experiment</strong></a>. These letters thus began to flow through indirect connections in social networks. Any one “chain” of letters however would flow from one link in the network to another. Theoretically it could come back to a person who had already sent the letter (if one of the people forward in the chain didn’t know that person had sent the letter before), but no one would forward the letter back to the same person they had forwarded the letter before. This means that the packages in the small world experiment traveled via <strong>trails</strong>. They could repeat nodes (e.g., people) but not edges. Gossip spreads through the network via trails too. You can hear the same piece of gossip from different friends (meaning that you are a repeated node in the trail), but you won’t hear the same piece of gossip from the <em>same</em> friend (meaning that edges are not repeated), unless they had memory loss!</p>
<p>So the differences between the ways viruses and gossip travel via social networks should help you keep walks and trails apart.</p>

<h2 data-number="12.10" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="local-bridges"><span class="header-section-number">12.10</span> Local Bridges</h2>
<p>In a classic paper on “The Strength of Weak Ties,” Mark <span class="citation" data-cites="granovetter73">Granovetter (<a href="#ref-granovetter73" role="doc-biblioref">1973</a>)</span> developed the concept of a <em>local bridge</em>. Recall from section <a href="#sec-bridges"><span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">sec-bridges</span></a>, that a bridge is an edge (or set of edges) that if removed would completely disconnect the graph. There is another way of thinking of bridges in the context of shortest paths and this is with respect to what happens to the connectivity between particular pairs of nodes in the graph when a specific edge is removed. From this perspective, a bridge is an edge (or set of edges) that if removed would increase the length of the shortest paths between two sets of nodes from a particular number to <em>infinity</em> since, in a disconnected graph, the length of the path between nodes that cannot reach one another is indeed infinity! (<span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>).</p>
<p>But of course, between a small number and infinity there’s a lot of in-between. That’s what the concept of a <strong>local bridge</strong> is intended to capture. A local bridge is an edge that if removed from the graph, would increase the length of the shortest path between <em>a particular pair</em> of nodes to a number that is less than infinity. This number is called the <em>degree</em> of the local bridge in question. Because a local bridge is always defined with respect to a particular pair of nodes, it is a triplet, involving two nodes and one edge.</p>

The reason for that is that, as shown in <a href="#fig-connected4-2">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected4-2</span></a>, when the edge <span class="math inline">\(HK\)</span> is removed from the graph, the shortest path_ between nodes <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> increases from <span class="math inline">\(l_{HK} =1\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> are adjacent in <a href="#fig-connected4-1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected4-1</span></a>) to <span class="math inline">\(l_{HK} = 4\)</span>, as given by the edge sequence <span class="math inline">\(\{GH, AG, AD, DK\}\)</span> (pictured in red). Note that from the perspective of nodes <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, the purple <span class="math inline">\(HK\)</span> edge is a local bridge of degree three, because <span class="math inline">\(l_{DH} = 2\)</span> in <a href="#fig-connected4-1">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected4-1</span></a> and <span class="math inline">\(l_{DH} = 3\)</span> when the edge <span class="math inline">\(HK\)</span> is removed from the graph in <a href="#fig-connected4-2">Figure&nbsp;<span class="quarto-unresolved-ref">fig-connected4-2</span></a>.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>That means that we can check whether an edge sequence is a path by seeing if the inner nodes appear more than twice in the edge list (in which case, it is not path), or whether the end nodes appear more than once in the edge list (in which case, it is also not path).<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
